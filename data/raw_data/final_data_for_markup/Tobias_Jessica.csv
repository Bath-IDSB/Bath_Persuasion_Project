	Persuadee: I donate to the charity twice a year already and today I would like to keep my full bonus.
Persuader: I completely understand and appreciate your past support. I would also like you to think about how your MTurk bonus could be put to good use in places like Syria and Myanmar where there are on going tragedies. You could do a lot of good with the additional donation today.
	Persuadee: Yes I understand that these are important causes that need donations.
Persuader: Think of it as giving up a cup of coffee today. I am not sure where you live, but I am in New York and you would be hard pressed to get a cup of coffee for $2. That money could really be used to help children in terrible situations and make their lives slightly better.
	Persuadee: Yes - I am sure that $2 dollars would be able to accomplish a lot more through Save the Children.
Persuader: Not only that, but think about it in the bigger picture. When all MTurk workers contribute their bonus payment today, it adds up to a lot of money very quickly. While you may think your $2 is not that much, when it is put together with all the other generous donations from MTurk workers, it really adds up quickly.
	Persuadee: I didn't think about it like that. This is something to consider. It would be a nice-sized donation.
Persuader: It really would. Your $2 along with everyone else's can make a big difference in the lives of other people. Would you reconsider your earlier decision?
	Persuadee: I don't think that I will donate anything today, sorry.

Persuader: It is a nonprofit organization. All money except 1% goes straight to the children and families.
	Persuadee: Well that's definitely very comforting. I know that some charities keep a lot of the money for themselves. Are these children from around the globe or just a specific country?
Persuader: The 1% is for overhead. That's understandable I'm sure. We help everywhere we are able too, so many countries.

	Persuadee: How do they do that?
Persuader: By people like you, making a a donation of just $1 a day, you can feed a child for a month.

	Persuadee: Have you donated to the charity?
Persuader: Not yet, it is something I am interested in doing though. Education is something that is really important to me and that is something that they help with. I think every child should have access to edcuation, especially in developing countries so that they can help improve their living situations. 
	Persuadee: Yes, I agree, did you grow up with the proper resources?
Persuader: I went through the public education system, it was one of the better school districts at the time. What about you? Is a lack of education something you faced?
	Persuadee: I went to private Catholic school until I was 13, then I went to Public schools which was a much better experience
Persuader: So you were able to have a good education experience as well. Isn't that something you would like to help other children receive? Anything from $0.01 to $2.00 or any amount you choose, it can go to helping them get an education. 
	Persuadee: Why is this charity worthy of my money?
Persuader: Think about how often you buy a pack of gum or a candy bar, something you don't really need but it is because you want it. You can just skip that next impulse purchase to help out. Save the Children does help more than education as well. They help ensure children's access to health care (which we know is a huge topic of discussion every where),and help improve their safety and well being. Many kids do not have access to safe living conditions to even make it to school each day. 
	Persuadee: I usually donate to animal shelters,where do you donate ?
Persuader: What ever charity my grocery store is supporting at the time. Typically children related, sometimes it is for others. It is easy to just add a couple cents on top of my purchase (round up the total) to help their cause. 
	Persuadee: yes, that is true I do that often at stores, how did you hear about Save the Children?
Persuader: I was directly contacted by the research team to help get donations for this amazing cause. Helping indirectly is one thing (like through the store) but actually giving when you can be a direct part is so much better. Wouldn't you like to give just $0.50 to this cause? It can provide paper and pencils to a child for school.

	Persuadee: It depends on what I am giving to. Am I giving to an organization or straight to another fellow human.
Persuader: I would argue that the recipient is not relevant. You see, in my opinion, Charity in and of itself is a selfish act. Or perhaps, a better way to say it is that it is more of an exchange. We exchange our time, energy, money etc for a powerful thing. That thing is called purpose.

Persuader: Well, I have one in mind specifically. It's called Save The Children. They seem pretty fantastic. Theyve single handedly reduced the infant mortality rate by 62% in third world countries. Can I verify that? Of course not. But I believe it. And thats what matters to me. I believe that the little I have to give could help, and because of that it makes me feel delightful. I'm doing my best with what I've got. Are you?

Persuader: They provide services to vulnerable children around the world.  Clean water, vaccines, etc... would you donate .15 cents? It is a small amount but added to other worker's donations it will go far in saving lives.
	Persuadee: Is there any link or page I can visit to get more information on the charity? I am currently donating already to another charity and I am extremely picky on who I donate to.
Persuader: Yes, Save the Children.org  The researchers will deduct any amount you would like to donate from your pay and make the payment for you.
	Persuadee: Alright, to whom does the money go to
Persuader: Save the Children.Your donation is really appreciated.  Recently for instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

	Persuadee: Is the charity a non profit group?
Persuader: Yes they are a non-profit
	Persuadee: What are your annual goals, needs, and results?
Persuader: In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services, 5% went to management, and 9% went to fundraising.  The goal is the more money raised the more services can be provided to children going through different disasters and crisis.
	Persuadee: Who are your main competitors and how do your results in recent years compare to theirs?
Persuader: In 2017 Save the Children helped 155 million children.  I don't know the statistics for other organizations.  The nice thing about this organization is the high percentage of money that goes directly to helping children and not overhead management costs. 
	Persuadee: Alright I have made a decision on how much to donate. I think overall the donation would not go to waste even if it is such a small amount.

Persuader: Yes, I have been asked to solicit a donation to the Save the Children charity.
	Persuadee: Oh I see. I'm the donator and you're the solicitor. So, what is the Save the Children charity? 
Persuader: It's been around almost forever.  Save the Children supports nutrition, sanitation and education initiatives in the US and third world countries.
	Persuadee: That sounds pretty good. I don't know why I've never heard of it. Doesn't sound like a charity someone could disagree with. Have they had any scandals or any thing? 
Persuader: None that I am aware of.  I'm surprised you've never heard of it.  They have run television commercials off and on for decades.
	Persuadee: Only thing that comes to mind is UNICEF. It also has kind of a generic name, but I suppose if it's been around so long, then others copied those sorts of names from them. But that could be why it isn't strong in my memory. 
Persuader: Less than 10% of the money raised goes for fund raising purposes, and only 5% for management.  Over 85% goes directly to recipients.  It is one of the most efficient charities around and is highly rated by the groups that do such things.

Persuader: You can donate the money that you are receiving for this mturk task, up to $2.  It's for a good cause.
	Persuadee: Ahhhh. I see. Ok that wasn\'t clear to me in my instructions. Alright. So, do I just say something specific like ""I would like to donate 2 dollars"" or do you have to ask me a specific question?
Persuader: I suspect that end of the conversation, you will be asked to donate a specific amount.  But it can't hurt to state how much of it you would like to donate.  With me, there's something about holiday weekends that makes me feel more charitable.
	Persuadee: Ok. I am going to donate the entire $2 then. Are you provided with any sort of incentive to make me donate more? The donation will stay the same regardless. Or are you not allowed to say?
Persuader: What I know is that the research team will collect all the money all the donations and send the money directly to Save the Children.
	Persuadee: I feel like that is a statement they told you to say if someone asks haha. That's fine. Like I said. I will keep the donation the same, I just was curious. I am I the only person you've had to ask? 
Persuader: Yes, you are.  Sometimes it's hard to figure out what some of these mturk tasks are going after.

Persuader: Indeed I am :) would it be alright with you if I spoke to you a little bit about a wonderful charity called Save The Children?
	Persuadee: Absolutely, I am a little familiar with that orginization....
Persuader: Thats great! Save The Children is a charity program that helps millions of children across the world. We provide numerous support groups and programs to help children everywhere. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. We provide protection to children and emotional support to them.
	Persuadee: wow.... My career is working with the homeless... i am thankful that we dont have to factor protection from real bodily harm into our work. Save the Children truly is a good cause
Persuader: That is amazing :) I have several friends and family that work together in my area to provide support for children and women against domestic violence. And to be able to speak to someone about the Save The Children Foundation is an honor. Across the US one in five children grows up in poverty. We have been around since 1932, providing support to the most isolated and under-served children in Rural America. The best program we offer in my opinion is Education and our programs to help children grieve and obtain the emotional support they need in order to grow.
	Persuadee: So Save The Children is 86 years old... that's incredible... a tremendous ammount of good has been done in all those years.... just out of curiosity, what is the percentage of donations that actually get to the need? i mean how much of every dollar is used for the actual program?
Persuader: Please don't hesitate to ask any questions. I am more than happy to provide information about our cause. 86% of our funding goes to  Program Services, 9% goes into fundraising meaning we get the word out about the charity and set up events. And just 5% goes to management and general things. Here is a link that breaks down all our costs and the donations we receive.  URL s/about-us/financial-information
	Persuadee: Please dont misunderstand... i think you are a little low though.... i think more like 88.3% goes to your programs which is an incredibly great amount by comparison... like i said, I also work in Charity so its very interesting to me
Persuader: PERSON_1: PERSON_1: PERSON_1: Our 86% was based off our 2017 annual report, I am sure there could be even more of a percentage as of late. Around 34% of donations go to health and nutrition, and my personal favorite is 21% into education benefits. I believe if we are able to give people a proper education they can learn so much and see that anything is possible in our world. That the world is not always cruel and that you can pull yourself from the ground up to the sky if you really want to. 
	Persuadee: I Completely agree.... and after all... we have to take care of our children because they are our future
Persuader: I would like to apologize for my mistype in the previous message. It seems as if my wording went over and it caused some issues for the system. I completely agree with you as well. If we do not help our children then there will be no future. Every childs life matters, and where we are not forced to help those that need it, a lot of people still find the compassion to see that even a little amount of money can go a long way in helping those around us less fortunate.
	Persuadee: you are absolutely correct... if a lot of people donate a little.... its still an astounding amount
Persuader: So based off our discussion would you be interested in donating to the charity now? Your donation would be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.
	Persuadee: I do not have a problem with that at all, as a matter of fact... i've been waiting for you to ask... hahaha
Persuader: Thats great! I would much rather give someone facts and accurate/detailed information about a cause or charity before asking for anything from said person. So that depending on what you like and what you hear you can make the decision yourself on what you feel would be a good donation. For I cannot decide how much you donate to the cause, but rather what I myself can donate. Do you have a figure in mind?
	Persuadee: I do, I was thinking Half of my payment which would be a total donation of $1

	Persuadee: I would have to give $0 right now. I agree with that mentality though, we can accomplish much with little. I hope to play my part in the future in this.
Persuader: Well that's good that you will keep save the children in your thoughts for a later time.
	Persuadee: Yes, I will and have you to thank for that. Also you make me positive about giving what I can when the time comes and it mattering to that cause.

Persuader: It seems vaguely familiar but I never paid attention specifically.  Have you ever donated to them?
	Persuadee: I have not but I have to some others recently
Persuader: Do you feel that Save the Children is a good charity to give to?  From what I'm reading, it sounds like a great cause
	Persuadee: I know a little can you maybe provide some info for me?
Persuader: It seems to be international, and supports children in developing countries.  It's apparently very influential in war zones like Syria
	Persuadee: Oh wow that is good to know.  I know Syria is a mess recently
Persuader: Absolutely.  It says on their site that in the first two months of this year alone, 1000 children were killed or injured there
	Persuadee: Ugh that is rough..  Nobody deserves that in this world
Persuader: I can't imagine what that's like for the parents.  As a mom myself, I'm thinking about donating my earnings from this task to them
	Persuadee: That sounds like a good idea so what amount is the max i can donate?
Persuader: From what I can tell, we can donate anywhere from 0 to $2 (the full payment).  Then through the official Save the Children website, I'm sure there's no max (and there'd be a tax deduction)

	Persuadee: There are always things in my community that I attend and donate as much as I can and donate my time as well at the local Salvation Army.
Persuader: I usually give to animal charities like the local no-kill shelter, but it's always interesting to learn about new places to make an impact.  Do you feel that you donate more in terms of money, or in terms of volunteering your time?

Persuader: I know, it can be hard to donate. especially in today's society, but a tiny amount, even less than a dollar, can go a long way
	Persuadee: That seems so hard to believe, but I guess lots of pennies still add up!
Persuader: Exactly, I feel the same way sometimes, but think if everyone in the US gave a nickel, that's over 16 million dollars
	Persuadee: Wow, that definitely puts it in perspective! 
Persuader: There are so many charities too, but I believe that children are the future, and we need to do what we can to help them have fulfilling lives

Persuader: Have you ever volunteered? It's another way to help without having to spend any money
	Persuadee: I have! I used to volunteer often, but I have so little time it feels like now!
Persuader: Time and money these days can be scarce! But think about the little things you buy, and maybe one week, instead of buying that bad of chips or cup of coffee, donate it to the children

	Persuadee: Yes. I am an empathetic person because I have children myself. 
Persuader: Oh that is good! I also have children. I have three girls. You? (I won't ask for any personal details - I promise.)
	Persuadee: I have a son and a daughter. Both are adults now but it seems like yesterday they were younger. 
Persuader: Ahh, yes I know what you mean. My oldest will be 21 next week, and the youngers ones are in their late teenage years. It goes by so quickly!
	Persuadee: Yes it does! My daughter is 19 and she is still living with us. Going to school for nursing. My son is 26 and lives with us because he is autistic and non-verbal.
Persuader: My husband has a little brother who has Asperger's. Not nearly the level of autism of your son, but I do have empathy for you. 
	Persuadee: Oh thank you so much. Me and my husband are very grateful that he is not as severe as some. He can pretty much understand everything you are saying and he can do many things for himself like eating, bathing, washing his clothes and many other things. It's just that the speech is not there. He started at 2 yrs. but it never developed.
Persuader: It must be very hard, and also at the same time very rewarding, taking care of a child with special needs.  It is interesting that your daughter is going to school for nursing. Do you think that it's because she has spent her life watching (and I'd assume participating in the) care of her brother?
	Persuadee: Yes, that is exactly what she said was the reason she got into nursing! She has been his right hand since she was born. She knows more about him than i do. :)
Persuader: Wow! You must be very proud of her! 
	Persuadee: Yes I am. I know you are proud of your daughters. What is your daughter going to college to do?
Persuader: She graduated with a degree in Interior Design. She has been a designer since she was about 3 years old! LOL  My other girls, though, have no idea what they like, except that they all like taking care of children (all work in day care or nanny jobs).
	Persuadee: That awesome! I always admire people who can visualize what is stylish for a room. I don't know a thing about decorating! And your other two sound like very compassionate and caring young ladies. You have to be to take care of little ones!
Persuader: I am with you there! I have absolutely zero flair for style. But my daughter has always been able to put things together so well. I honestly don't know where she got it from! But, I am happy that at least someone in the family can make us look good. Haha  And yes, they are all so good with little ones. It does make me feel good to see that. I feel like I must have done some good things right as a mom, if they like kids so much!
	Persuadee: Yes indeed! Some people are not as fortunate to have parents such as us. But I think that I did pretty good myself! My son did learn some living skills and learning more and my daughter is in school. 
Persuader: I am sure you have done a great job with both of your kids! It sounds like they are very special!  I didn't design it this way, but I am glad that we talked about our kids so much.
