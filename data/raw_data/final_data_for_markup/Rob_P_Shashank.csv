564,"Persuader: Hello.
	Persuadee: Hi
Persuader: Have you heard of Save the Children?
	Persuadee: Yes I have
Persuader: Good. It's a very strong and important organization. The lack of child support in developing countries, such as in Syria, has been growing for years now.
	Persuadee: Does this organization help people in the USA?
Persuader: No, they assist children in war zones. In Syria, in 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reported to be killed of injured due to rising violence.
	Persuadee: How much of the proceeds go directly towards the children?
Persuader: For every dollar donated, they receive 77 cents. It's a higher rate than most charities, because while we want most of the money to go to the children, there also needs to be some paid employees, although most are volunteers. Would you be interested in saving a child's life today?
	Persuadee: No, thank you.
Persuader: Are you sure? How many dollars do you spend everyday on pointless or unnecessary items, such as a candy bar or fast food?
	Persuadee: I'm sure. I work hard for money so I spend it the way I want.
Persuader: These children have no way of earning money, as their countries are in shambles. Many die of hunger or preventable disease, up 5.6 million per year. Even 50 cents makes all the difference.
	Persuadee: I'm not interested in this charity.
Persuader: Are you from the US?
	Persuadee: Yes I am
Persuader: Are you aware of the US bombing civilian cities in developing countries? Killing innocent children for no reason at all? 
	Persuadee: Yes I am but I am not interested in this charity.
Persuader: It also helps children in Europe. France, Germany, Sweden. The refugee crisis has caused many children in such countries to be without basic necessities. Even the children who were originally from Europe.
	Persuadee: It's a terrible situation however I only donate to American charities. ",False,0.0
565,"Persuader: Good morning.
	Persuadee: Good morning, I think children are so important and charities that involve them are needed and we should participate our money or our time.
Persuader: I agree. I would like to tell you about the organization Save the Children. They promote children's rights and help support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: Oh that's wonderful, what a great organization. Where can I read more about this organization and possible give a donate?
Persuader: You could look at their website URL to get more information. You can make a donation directly from your payment from this task.
	Persuadee: Ok, I will consider doing that.  What a great idea!  I would like to read a little about the charity before donating. How would I donate directly from this task?
Persuader: The research team will collect the donations and send it to save the Children.
	Persuadee: I would like to donate 10 cents from this task to Save the Children please.
Persuader: Ok, so that 10 cents will come out of your payment and you will keep the rest of the task payment
	Persuadee: Yes, thank you.  I am poor and I can relate to the children who are also poor.  I really need the money that i'm earning for this task, so I feel like giving 10 cents to this charity is fair.  Do you agree?
Persuader: I feel that this is very generous of you. Thank you for agreeing to make a donation.
	Persuadee: Your welcome, it is a good feeling to help others in need. I appreciate you telling me about this organization and directing me to their website.
Persuader: I am glad to share this iinformation. I feel that it is an important organization.
	Persuadee: Yes it is.  I always wanted children of my own and could never conceive a child. So I have much empathy for these children and their needs.  I will tell friends and family to visit the charities website also.
Persuader: That is very kind of you to spread the word about this charity. Thank you for all that you are doing.
	Persuadee: How many years has Save The Children been doing charity work?
Persuader: This organization has been around for a long time. I am not sure they exact number of years
	Persuadee: That's good. These days there are tons of people asking for donations for fake charities, it's sad. 
Persuader: Yes it is, but this is a good organizations and I really appreciate your donation
	Persuadee: I want to thank you again for bringing awareness to this important charity. In America food is plentiful and we sometimes have to stop and reflect, that other countries aren't as fortunate as we are!",False,0.3
566,"Persuader: It would be a great deal to donate all or some the extra payment to children's charity
	Persuadee: What children's charity is it?
Persuader: Save the Children 
	Persuadee: Could you tell me more about them?
Persuader: This is an organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries
	Persuadee: Oh do they not do any work in the United States?
Persuader: Good question, although we have many charities in the U.S., these children are dying from hunger and your donation will make a great impact
	Persuadee: I don't like to hear about kids starving, but I would prefer to take care of kids in the U.S. first.
Persuader: That's caring of you, I'm sure there is a reachable charity in the U.S. that you can get involved in, but there is a great lack of support for these kids, especially in war zones
	Persuadee: So what countries have they helped kid out in?
Persuader: Millions of Syrian children have to grow up facing the daily threat of violence, 2018, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured. Your donation will help address this problem
	Persuadee: I do donate to charity already so I'm not sure how much I can afford to donate to them, if I decide to donate at all.
Persuader: Well, think about how we spend on unnecessary things, money that we can't account for. A fraction of that amount can make a drastic change
	Persuadee: What is the minimum amount that I can donate?
Persuader: $.77 a day can shelter a refugee family
	Persuadee: That's crazy that a small amount like that can make such a difference.
Persuader: Yes, it sure can

Persuader: It is an international organization, working in 120 countries. They work on health and hunger mainly
	Persuadee: Yes, you are right.Have you donate to any charity before?
Persuader: Yes I used to donate here and there, since I\'ve started working on MTurk, I have donated through HITs. I donated to ""Save the Children"" before. They are very transparent with their financial reports
	Persuadee: That's really a great job.
Persuader: Yes, they are also connected to some big companies like IKEA and Disney
	Persuadee: Really, we are also trying to connected like that charity.
Persuader: Yes, You can donate at the end of this task. I donated $0.50 and $1 before and it did not even hurt my payment.

Persuader: Do you donate to any charities?
	Persuadee: yes,I like to donate.
Persuader: Me too!! Have you heard or know about Save the Children foundation?
	Persuadee: Yes, but not that much
Persuader: They are non-governmental which is why I usually tend to go towards them.  They help children in developing countries and get the basic needs met.
	Persuadee: Really, that's a great to hear.
Persuader: I am going to donate part of my payment from this task to them, just a small amount. Would you be willing to donate a small amount as well?
	Persuadee: Yes, sure I will also like to donate them.
Persuader: Ok great!! It looks like it costs .77 a day can shelter a family. I think I will donate .40
	Persuadee: I like to donate 0.40. Let's save a family.
Persuader: Right?! It is not much but if it can do that much for a day for a whole family, its minimal impact even for us slightly struggling.
	Persuadee: Yes, You are Right.We can save a family but our donation really help them a little.
Persuader: For sure!  Where abouts are you from? I currently live in Virginia.
	Persuadee: I am from Iowa.
Persuader: I feel like I probably should donate to some of the locals in the area because there has been an insane increase in the homeless around here. Is it bad in Iowa?
	Persuadee: yes, Her many people suffering for their food shelter everything. I have donated  them.
Persuader: It is awful everywhere. I do the same, I donate what I can and usually try to mentor some of them to try and help them find shelter and jobs.  Some people can be helped for sure!

	Persuadee: I prefer warmer temperatures, I absolutely despise the cold haha. 
Persuader: Yes  me too! How do you feel about children who are suffering and need help
	Persuadee: That's a loaded question if I've ever heard one... I thought this was going to be some active participant study on interaction between conflicting personalities or something like that. I'll play along though. I feel sad, helpless and a bit perturbed if I'm honest.
Persuader: Well Im sorry you feel that way. I just wanted to know if you have ever donated or helped kids in need?
	Persuadee: Yes I have, though I'm wary of doing so currently, too many organizations abuse that funding.
Persuader: I hear you! I donated per month to compassion international for years and years! I supported a young girl who is grown now.
	Persuadee: I currently work with some people who travel the Southwestern US and set up CSA farms and connect them via outreach centers to people who need food or labor. I find action helps more than money, sends a deeper message and imparts a strong work ethic to those you help.
Persuader: I do agree with that to a point. Action does help but these companies do need monetary support as well or they cannot trhrive.
	Persuadee: Couldn't agree more.
Persuader: That's wonderful! Have you head of the organization Save the Children?
	Persuadee: Yes I have.
Persuader: They are needing a lot of help currently, there are more and more kids needing help.
	Persuadee: Like I said, I'm more of the opinion action is the better choice. I always ask myself, why are these kids starving? Why are those directly responsible for the children unable to care for them? To me it comes down to failure as a species. We allow this travesty to continue and think throwing money at it will help. It wont.
Persuader: That makes sense to a point. Without funding the companies cannot help. Anyway heres my question How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).? 
	Persuadee: I don't believe I will donate anything. $0.

Persuader: yes! It is some important because so many kids die from hunger and any small donation makes a huge difference

Persuader: That is so wonderful of you! Would you be interested in donating today?
	Persuadee: I can't at this moment because I just don't have anything extra.
Persuader: The smallest amount would make a world of difference in these children's lives. You could choose any amount of you 2.00 task payment to donate. It would be greatly appreciated.

	Persuadee: Yes, although there are several similar schools around the US and across the world. What type of organizations do you support, Elvir?
Persuader: I support NPOs that engage in promoting childrens rights, providing relief and helping support children in developing countries. One NPO mainly being Save the Children.
	Persuadee: That is wonderful. I am slightly familiar with Save the Children. Do you think that they are effective?
Persuader: They are very effective at their mission, making an international impact with professional and cautious use of the donation they receive. They are one of few NPO's who actually use their funds for their purpose.
	Persuadee: Yes, mis-use and waste is a huge problem in with NPOs. For this reason I like and support Smile Train - they repair cleft lips using local resources. 
Persuader: Thats awesome! The amazing thing about the Save the Children mission is that 77 cents only can host a child in need for shelter for one day!

Persuader: They help out in 192 countries and counting.  Their main mission is to ensure children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.  There has been a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

Persuader: Yes, about 9 out of 10 dollars go straight to the children while the other dollar would go to making sure that they can expand their capabilities and continue to help
	Persuadee: That is a very good ratio. Not many charities that are famous to us do that.
Persuader: It is a very good ration and I love that they are transparent about it.  No pressure here but do you change your mind on donating?  Even if it is a small donation every penny will help these people in need

	Persuadee: Hi Tommy I'm Cassidy. I've been using mTurk on and off for about half a year but the past month I've really commmited to doing tasks everyday. It's great to earn extra money here and there. I'm glad you're enjoying it. 
Persuader: Well thanks, Cassidy.  It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.  I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.  For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.  And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.  How about you, Cassidy?  Do you like giving to charities? 
	Persuadee: I do enjoy donating to charities. I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year. And when I can't give monetarily donate food, my time, and go to blood drives on my university
Persuader: Aww, that's really considerate of you. I have two sponsored kids myself, one from Ghana and one from Mexico and they send me letters every month.  Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.  I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.  It's really sweet.  Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.  Have you heard of Save the Children?
	Persuadee: No, I haven't heard of Save the Children. And its awesome that you help out those kids in need
Persuader: The thing is, Cassidy, is that I don't have any of my own right now, so it kind of fills a need, you know? I like Save the Children because they rank towards the top of reputable charities on the ranking sites. The other thing is that they allow for small donations which have a big impact in countries like Syria where the local currency has dropped so considerably.  It's really really sad what's going on over there.  Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know?
	Persuadee: Yeah, 50 cents isn't too bad. Maybe I'll consider donating to them
Persuader: Well, personally, I've made about 8 dollars already here today, so I'm going to donate the 30 cents from this HIT to them.  Did you know that there is an option to do that for this HIT?
	Persuadee: No, I didn't know but thank you for telling me! I think I might donate mine too!
Persuader: I say we do it together!  See, Cassidy, no single one of us can fix all the problems in this world. There is too much suffering, too many children growing up in poverty and trauma.  But together, if we stick together, if we put our money together, you'd be surprised how much we can change in this world.  How many lives we can help.  What do you say, Cassidy, do you want to join me today in helping these kids?
	Persuadee: Yes I do, you've really inspired me Tommy
Persuader: Great!  That's so generous of you.  How much would you like to donate to them today?  Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.  You can choose any amount from  zero to the whole .30 cents.  Personally, I'm giving them the full amount.

Persuader: It\'s called ""Save the Children"". It basically fights for children\'s rights in developing countries, so it gives them access to education, healthcare, shelter, etc.
	Persuadee: This is one strange hit! I think I would rather donate to help people and children here in the USA.
Persuader: Agreed! I understand that, I thought that myself until I heard about the awful conditions some of these kids are going through. I've read story after story of these poor kids being abused, starved, and dying in the streets. It breaks my heart. 
	Persuadee: Breaks mine too but the world is full of things like that. Many heart breaking stories right here at home too.
Persuader: Me too. I guess I'm more sympathetic because here we at least have foundations to help these kids. Children Protective Services, Child Aid USA, Ronald McDonald House, etc. I just feel like these kids aren't given a chance.

Persuader: That's awesome! I did some research and online they have a whole spreadsheet on where the money actually goes which is good.

Persuader: No but I can tell you about the charity!
	Persuadee: Sure! I'd love to hear more. Go on...
Persuader: Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety
	Persuadee: Have you ever sponsored a child? If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?
Persuader: The usual cost is about $36 per child. I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child
	Persuadee: That's actually quite reasonable! I doesn't cost much. I hope they allow for pen pals as well. Sounds like a blessed organization.
Persuader: Yes it does. Their website is  URL if you would like to read more

	Persuadee: Not right at the moment. I haven't find any good one to donate too.
Persuader: I know, it is hard to find one that you feel is actually using a majority donations for the recipients and not for administrative costs. I did some research and decided on Save the Children. Have you heard of them?
	Persuadee: No I have not. What do they do?
Persuader: They provide health care, education, protection and emergency aid for children all over the world. Nearly 6 million children die each year due to malnourished, lack of care and treatment for preventable diseases, among other things. I was so impressed by their program that I have made them my first choice for donations.
	Persuadee: That sounds really good and all, but I'm looking for something that helps our children right here in America. It always seem that charities help other places, but what about the children right here at home.
Persuader: That was my first question, also, when I started my research, and they are actively involved here, also. Save the Children is an international program so  you can specify  where you want your donation applied.
	Persuadee: That is awesome. It is just really hard to donate when I have to think of my own family. Not easier to give money to other when I have bills that needs to come first and my own children to think about
Persuader: I agree. I am also a parent and my family's needs have always come first. I have been able to set aside a very small donation for this organization by telling my kids that they can help another child who is not as fortunate as they are by contributing a small portion of their allowance each week. At first, of course there was grumbling but I showed them pictures of the kids they would be helping and they decided to help.
	Persuadee: That is very awesome. I don't pay my kids allowance so that wouldn't work for me. I tell them their allowance is the power to play on their tablet and the internet they use.
Persuader: Guess that wouldn't work!  Am sure you would be surprised that the smallest amount would be enough to help thousands of children, and sometimes by just not buying that snack or a cup of coffee would be enough to send as a donation.  
	Persuadee: I would love to I just don't have it to spare today
Persuader: We are all responsible for the children of the world and it is our duty to care for their well being. I had hoped that you would be a part of this amazing organization. You are a part of the solution and just a few cents added up over a month would help.
	Persuadee: I know it is our responsible, but again my family is first and for most and I don't have any to spare right now
Persuader: I see, well when you have a few cents to spare remember this organization, Save the Children.

Persuader: when this task ends you will be asked about the donation
	Persuadee: Very well! Anything else you wanna chat about hah?
Persuader: just so you know the research team will collect all donations and send it directly!  This is wonderful!
	Persuadee: Yes it is wonderful!
Persuader: You are so great!  Thank you very much!  You will feel great about your donation!  Have a wonderful day!
	Persuadee: Thank you. is there a submit button or do I wait for the chat to end? I do hope the children are being helped.",False,0.15
