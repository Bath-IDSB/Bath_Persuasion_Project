	Persuadee: I am doing well, how are you?
Persuader: I honestly can't complain too much, not too much going on
	Persuadee: Are you excited for Labor Day coming up?
Persuader: Oh yes, I can't wait for a day off you?
	Persuadee: Yeah it should be good, my boss just told me she's giving us Friday off too so it's a nice 4 day weekend.
Persuader: That's perfect, quick question, have you heard of the charity Save the Children?
	Persuadee: No I've never heard of it before
Persuader: Basically it's a charity that is helping impoverished children across the world, but especially recently in Myanmar receive adequate shelter and supplies 
	Persuadee: What kind of supplies?
Persuader: Hygiene supplies such as toothbrushes, sanitary pads, bandages, soap, diapers as well as emergency shelter tents 
	Persuadee: Oh, well that's nice
Persuader: Yes, they also purchase farm animals for the families so that they may begin to rebuild. In addition 86% of all of their funding is actually being spent on supplies for these individuals which is astounding
	Persuadee: That's unique, I don't know if I've ever heard of a charity that gave families their own animals
Persuader: Yeah, it surprised me too, I never really thought about how much some families really need farm animals before for food, labor and transportation
	Persuadee: People don't really think much about the value of farm animals in general, I think
Persuader: I think that's true. Would you possibly like to donate some of your task earnings to Save the Children today?
	Persuadee: No, I don't think so.
Persuader: Okay, well if you decide you would like to donate any of your earnings from this task, you can choose any amount from $0 all the way to $2. The research team will collect all the donations and send it to Save the Children
	Persuadee: Well thank you for letting me know, but I'm going to stick with $0 for today.
Persuader: Okay, thank you for your time",False,0.0
678,"Persuader: Hello, how are you today? Have you ever heard of Save the Children?
	Persuadee: No, I have not heard of save the children. What is that? 
Persuader: Save the Children is an organization that helps children all around the world that are in need. Where are you from?
	Persuadee: That sounds like a nice organization! Do you know who founded the organization? I am from the United States. 
Persuader: The Save the Children Fund was founded in London, England, on 15 April 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton as an effort to alleviate starvation of children in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany of World War I which continued after the Armistice. Today they work to help in health, education, protection, hunger and livelihood, crisis management, and advocacy for children around the world. Which of those sounds the most interesting?
	Persuadee: Wow, I did not know that they did so much for the children! I honestly am not sure which is the most interesting because honestly they are doing so much goodness in the world. I love that they are making a difference in the young generation. It's interesting that it started during WWI and is still going today. Where are you from ? 
Persuader: I am also from the United States, in South Carolina. I live in a rural town and many of the families around here are poor and have been poor for a long time. One of the major reasons for poverty is a lack of education, even from a very young age. Do you have any interest in doing your part to help out these children to help them rise from poverty?
	Persuadee: SC is beautiful, although I have never been there.  I agree that lack of education can cause poverty, and it is a sad thing. Do you think it is hard for certain groups to get out of the poverty line? To me it seems when individuals are born into poverty because parents lack of education, thus leading to their own, it is kind of like a circle. do you believe this as well? I am interested in how I can help these children.
Persuader: Yes exactly! In America, more than 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. In rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Save Our Children reached 638,000 kids 2016 through their programs! This is a good start, and you can help to do more. In this HIT, you are able to donate a portion of your $2 earnings to save the children. The researchers will collect the donations from the chat-logs and send them to Save the Children! Would you like to hear more about the education programs or any other programs before you decide how much to donate?
	Persuadee: Wow, I did not even know the specifics of that statistic. I am wondering how much of my donation would go directly to the program, as I know that there are some sketchy organizations out there that pocket the money. Would my donation be split up between different areas of the organization, like some going to education, others to food drives, etc? 
Persuader: Save or Children is actually one of the good ones! Nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to our mission _ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe. This percentage is adjusted each year end _ as of 2017, it is 86%. The rest? Save our Children uses it to support the mission _ running our programs and raising funds to help more children. The funds would be split to different programs they run that support the mission. Should I tell you about some other programs in the mission?
	Persuadee: Yeah, I would like to hear about the programs, what are some of them? 
Persuader: One example is Syria. After 7 years of war, Syria is now the #1 most dangerous country to be a child. ""There is no food and we can\'t go outside. the planes are bombing,"" says a terrified child. ""One of my friends died in front of me - and I saw the blood,"" cries another. According to a boy in besieged Eastern Ghouta, ""It feels like the end of the world."" Save the Children provides lifesaving services and supplies. They tend to children\'s physical and psychological needs and set up places for children in crisis to learn and play.
	Persuadee: Yes, I know about the atrocities happening in Syria right now, and how much it is affecting the children. I honestly can't even imagine going through that, let alone as a child. Even though I myself am not syrian, or know any syrians, it makes me eternally grateful that there are services going to the mental well-being of the children and that is even being considered, because I feel like mental issues tend to get pushed aside. 
Persuader: Yes and you can help for less than the price of a cup of coffee! Despite extreme humanitarian challenges, Save the Children has helped 2.5 million people in Syria, including 1.7 million children. This is just one of the many amazing programs that Save the Children does around the world. Do you think you would like to make a donation today?
	Persuadee: Okay one last question, where does the other 10% go, if 90% goes to the actual organization? 
Persuader: Well it all goes to the organization, the way that they use the money about 90% goes to funding programs in rural America, Syria, etc...and 10% goes to the running costs of events, administrative costs, etc... which also - even if a little indirectly - help further their mission. How much would you like to give? You can give any amount up to $2 out of your HIT reward
	Persuadee: I am going to give .50 out of my $2. I hope you understand. 
Persuader: Ok thank you for your donation of $0.50! Taking a bit out of your mturk earnings to do some good in the world!

Persuader: Okay, let me inform you. Save the Children is a foundation that helps children all across the world. There are many children that are in major need of help. 
	Persuadee: Oh, nice. What kind of things do they for kids?
Persuader: Helps feed, clothe and provides shelter for children who are in need. Millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. 
	Persuadee: So the charity helped the Syrian children?
Persuader: Oh yes and others all over the globe. Would you donate to this charity today?

	Persuadee: All 3 of mine are girls, my 2 cats are girls, and plus my wife.  I'm looking to find some sort of male presence in my house.  Maybe I should get a dog.
Persuader: Dang, defying the odds there with three girls. I've always wanted a dog but we're pretty tight on money plus the apartment we live in doesn't allow pets unfortunately.
	Persuadee: We just moved into a bigger house so when they are teenagers I won't have to fight for a bathroom
Persuader: That must be nice. Flip the toilet paper the way you want, leave the seat up etc. I wish we could afford a house but it's too expensive where we live.
	Persuadee: They are pretty affordable here right now, but the market is climbing.  With rising interest rates it'll make it even harder.  This will be the last time I move until I retire though.
Persuader: Putting down roots, eh? Say, what would you think of a donation to  URL  Not everyone is as fortunate as us and I'm planning to donate $1 to them as part of this HIT.
	Persuadee: nope, I'm very generous with my donations but I'm not willing to give to organizations that have top heavy costs.

	Persuadee: No, I have my preferred charities and they are not on my list
Persuader: I understand. It's good to do your research and at least you're not sitting idly by and being part of the problem.

	Persuadee: This looks like a great cause!
Persuader: Indeed it is, helping children find education and a safe environment are very good causes. How do you feel about charities?
	Persuadee: I feel like charities are worth supporting as long as I know my money is being spent well and not mismanaged
Persuader: I can understand that, Save the children's only focus is to help kids who cannot help themselves. Some of which are in war form countries or who are on the brink of starvation.
	Persuadee: That sounds amazing. How can I help out?
Persuader: Today you have the opportunity to use a portion of your task fund to go straight towards Save the Children. It is up to you how much you'd like to give. Between 0$ and 2$ but just keep in mind as little as .50 cents can go a long way in these countries. How much would you be willing to give of the 2$ towards this cause?

Persuader: That's fantastic! After the task is over you will get the opportunity to do so. 
	Persuadee: On average, how much money do you normally see people donate from similar tasks?
Persuader: It varies, sometimes we have people who choose to not donate. However a lot of the time we generally see at least some of the money going to this great cause, even up to the maximum of 2%
	Persuadee: That doesn't sound too bad at all
Persuader: I agree, I also put in at least 2$ a day myself towards this great endeavor. Knowing that it goes to a good cause feels good.
	Persuadee: That's great! Although charity is a good cause, I want to feel like my time is being valued so I want to leave $1 for myself
Persuader: Thank you so much, every amount helps! We are almost done here at which point you will be able to do that. How else do you think we could further help those in need besides what you've seen so far?
	Persuadee: I would volunteer and help others in my local community by showing up to events in person
Persuader: Wow that's fantastic! You are very altruistic, and for that we appreciate you a great deal. If everyone saw the world the same as you did, these problems would exist.
	Persuadee: Thank you for the kind words! What would you do?
Persuader: I'd like to see the service branch out, helping women in these countries as well. The countries that these problems occur in women are often not treated the same as we are generally accustomed to.
	Persuadee: I too believe that women should have equal opportunities as men across the world - there are likely many different charities out there that better support that cause

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

I was hoping you would be interested in supporting another great organization, Save the Children. They are also really trustworthy. Your donation to them helps ensure children's right to health, education, safety, etc.
	Persuadee: My willingness to donate to charities is always reliant on my current financial situation, currently my finances are fairly unstable and I need every penny that I can scrounge up. Perhaps in the future when I have more disposable income I would be willing to undertake such a proposal, but sadly right now I cannot.
Persuader: I know exactly how you feel. I've been sick with cancer for about 12 years now. We pretty much live paycheck to paycheck. But I felt so useless sometimes, I decided I would make it work. So I do these little side jobs in order to pay for sponsoring my Indian boy.
	Persuadee: Yes, paycheck to paycheck, the story of my life, and imagine doing this in order to eat, But that's not what we are here to discuss, we need to come to some sort of resolution about this donation. How do we go about that?

Persuader: Not any specific amount, anything can be good, no matter small or big. I usually donate to big organizations myself, and I have a soft heart for children

Persuader: I donate most of my bonus when I can, I feel like it is free money and others deserve it more. The good thing about it is when you want to donate on websites they usually have a minimum, but with HITs there is no minimum amount

Persuader: I do not, but I am an advocate for their cause.  If you are comfortable with donating up to $2 of your bonus, you may, the researchers will take the amount you specify out of your bonus.
	Persuadee: Do you know any more information about where the money specifically goes to?
Persuader: I personally do not, though I have seen concrete evidence through unbiased sources that save the children does do charitable work.  If you ever heard the term, ""save a child for a cup of coffee""  it came from them.
	Persuadee: Definitely. And I am not doubting that they do good work I was just curious about how they allocate their donations. Going back to the United Way I mentioned earlier they actually let you decide where your donations get put to work. If you would like them to choose for you they have a community fund.
Persuader: Oh I get that, I guess that will be in the hands of the researchers themselves.  I am sure save the children allows specific donations to go to specific needs, but you would be donating through a ""3rd party"" so to speak.  Would you like to contribute?
	Persuadee: You said up to $2 but my payment for this is only $0.30 so I am not sure how this works
Persuader: Oh, there is a bonus of $2 for completing this task, after we speak there will be a section where you can designate how much you would like to donate.
	Persuadee: I see. That makes more sense. I will most likely donate some of the bonus then. That makes it easy
Persuader: Very nice, I will match whatever amount you declare here, how about that?

	Persuadee: Fine, thank you. How do you feel about donating to a children's charity?
Persuader: I always they to donate when ever I am able. Especially childrens charities, children are so innocent and deserve the best chance at life.
	Persuadee: But do you really trust the charities that you give to? Do you know if they are actually using that money for the intended purpose?
Persuader: YEs I always look into the charities that i donate to. For instance I always donate to our local childrens hospital because my nephew was treat there when he was diagnosed with cancer. I saw how many sick little kids where there fight for their lives. So I also donate to the hospital and childrens cancer network because the money goes directly to research cancers that effect children.
	Persuadee: I agree, the local charities are good. I don't trust the bigger charities. I think most of the money that is donated goes towards salaries, etc.
Persuader: Sadly that is true some times. How do you feel about donating to childrens charities?
	Persuadee: I think it is better to help children yourself. That way, you know what the money is being used for. Also, when you do it yourself, it is a lot more rewarding.
Persuader: True, but there are so many innocent little children who don't have access to food or clean water, not to mention basic health needs. We are lucky to have help if needed they have no one to turn to.
	Persuadee: How much do you usually donate every year>
Persuader: I try to donate at least 250 every year. 
	Persuadee: That is good. Do you have any kids?
Persuader: Yes, I have two and I have a lot of nephews and nieces, 1 has a lot of  health issues so childrens charities are always important to me. Do you have children?
	Persuadee: I do not have any children yet, do you think that having kids had a big effect on whether on not you are willing to donate to a children's charity?
Persuader: Yes, probably but my nephew got sick before I had kids and thats what made me realize that cancer or any illness can happen to anyone whether its your child or some one close to you. It is the scariest thing that can happen to anyone especially a child. Once I saw how many children were fighting cancer and other serious disease it woke me up to what is important in life and just because we are not going through it there are so many children suffering that the least I can do is donate.
	Persuadee: That is a great way to think about it. I'm sure that when I have kids, my thinking will change a lot as well. So I think that we should donate .10 each to the children. What do you think?
Persuader: Yes I am fine with that
	Persuadee: It is a small amount, but I think that every penny can make a lot of difference. If half the people in the world just donated 10 cents to such charities, then we would raise a LOT of money. It is not necessary to donate hundreds of dollars.
Persuader: Yes that is what I believe to, We wouldn't even notice 10 cents we spend so much on coffee little things the .10 cents is nothing.
	Persuadee: Agreed. We spend so much money on other things, but the moment someone asks for a little charity, we make up many excuses. We will donate .10 and hopefully that will make a difference.",False,0.1

Persuader: You could think of donating even a quarter as a good bit of karma.
	Persuadee: I guess but I need every penny I make on mTurk. 
Persuader: Well you can be part of the solution and help these children, but if you need to small amount I will not hold it against you.
	Persuadee: I am going to keep the money.  Sorry.  I wouldn't expect anyone working on mTurk to give away these hard earned pennies.  If they are looking for people to be a part of the solution they should find people with money to burn

I wanted to get a feel for whether your interests tended to be focused on people, environment, etc. and I'm glad to hear that you are concerned for people's well-being. Unfortunately the donation I want to bring up isn't directly related to illness, but it is related to the health and livelihood of people. Have you heard of Save the Children?
	Persuadee: It souns vaguely familiar does it help children in this country
Persuader: one of the beautiful things about it is that it helps children in the US AND around the world. (I myself sometimes get a bit discouraged or feel like my personal donations don't mean as much if its reach is too localized. Especially when it's something as important as helping and in many cases rescuing children from violent areas or from malnutrition/disease. Thousands of children die every day due to circumstances that are completely outside of their control and this organization actually helps to provide them with stability which eventually will better our global future.
	Persuadee: that sounds like something I wuld be interested in.
Persuader: Awesome! I'm happy to hear it. At the end of the day kids are particularly vulnerable so this organization's mission is one that I feel really strongly about.

Persuader: I understand completely and I hope your son is doing better and continues to stay healthy! From what I'm seeing, the donation gets deducted from the task payment and even though it seems like a small donation (in the grand scheme of things) they put 90% of donations to direct aid so every dollar really adds up
	Persuadee: Yes he is doing better thank you for saying.  Yes every dollar adds up.  I think it is a worthy cause
Persuader: Great! I'm glad to have been matched with a generous person :)
	Persuadee: I agree great minds think alike
Persuader: Yes! And if this HIT keeps the same charity for all of the workers, then I think it's great that it's getting visibility too
	Persuadee: I didn;t even think aout it like that but you are right.  I think if we could all just donate a tiny bit of our income it would help everybody
Persuader: That's a great idea. I would too even if it's a small percentage. This is on a similar topic but not directly related, but just in case you shop on Amazon and didn't know-- if you shop through smile.amazon.com you can actually choose a charity that gets a portion of donations on the money you spent. Doesn't cost you extra, I'm sure there are ones devoted to breast cancer!

Persuader: The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.  The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.  It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.
	Persuadee: That's interesting and sounds good, right?
Persuader: Yeah, it does sound good.  Of course it's your decision, in the end.  I am kind of curious about the details though.  How much do you like to donate to the charity now?  The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.  Or nothing, if that's what you decide.
	Persuadee: I think i will make a donation of $2
Persuader: That's wonderful!  I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.  It was great chatting with you.  And thanks for helping!",False,0.0
