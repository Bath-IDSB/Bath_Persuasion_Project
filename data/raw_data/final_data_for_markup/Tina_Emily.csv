Persuader: I'm great! How are you?
	Persuadee: Doing fairly well. I just ate dinner and feel relaxed. 
Persuader: That is good to hear! So,are you familiar with the Save The Children children charity?
	Persuadee: Yes, I have heard of them. That is the one that scammed people out of money after the hurricane, right?
Persuader: Wait wait wait,are you serious? I haven't heard about that.Was this recent?
	Persuadee: I think last year I belive. Wasn't there a major hurricane?
Persuader: That may have been the American Red Cross. I think I heard something about them not using all of the funds given to them to help the people that were hurt during.
	Persuadee: Ok, because I remember Bon Jovi trying to put together a concert to gather money. I thought he was representing saves the children.
Persuader: Oh,I love Bon Jovi. Knowing how great he is I'm pretty sure he helps a ton of charity's. 
	Persuadee: I know, but he has been ""living on a prayer"" for a long while now

	Persuadee: So I will loose some of my bonus money?
Persuader: It will be deducted from your bonus,but you hold the power of how much will be taken. Like me I would enjoy my max amount so to show good faith to the researchers completing this task I would just throw 0.01-0.10. 
	Persuadee: Ok so I will choose to donate .10

Persuader: Exactly.More than thousands children have died of hunger in Syria this year.We must do something about it
	Persuadee: for sure we must do something, but many people are blind, they see just the green of the money, they dont interact with people to see whats their problems are, i really want to help go in africa or some place but i dont know how i can go with a organization.

	Persuadee: Hi, I'm doing OK, how are you?
Persuader: I am fine thanks. Are you interested in donating?
	Persuadee: Possibly, I'm not sure. I don't even know what the charity is.
Persuader: The organization which collects money from people, and spend it on people and issues which are needed
	Persuadee: Right, but I would like to know specifically what organization.
Persuader: I myself have a soft heart for children and usually help the charities for children. Have you heard of ""Save the Children""?
	Persuadee: Yes. Are you planning to donate?
Persuader: I am planning to donate. I heard about this organization few weeks ego on MTurk, and i too k the time to read about it. It took my attention and I donated on the last HITs i did
	Persuadee: OK. I only like to donate to reputable organizations, I am familiar with save the children, they often advertise.
Persuader: Yes , they are connected to big companies. They work in 120 countries on different issues. I am careful when I want to donate too
	Persuadee: I'm not sure how this donation process will work, do you know the specifics? I always like to know how the donations are spent.
Persuader: same here, this organization publishes brief financial reports on its website. I've checked on this link:  URL s/about-us/financial-information
	Persuadee: thanks. i wonder what a reasonable donation amount would be.
Persuader: on the website there is a minimum amount but through HIT you can donate anything even 1 cent. I donated before and surprisingly it did not even hurt my reward. I thought it will
	Persuadee: Great. Then I will do it. I usually donate to animal charities.
Persuader: I love animals. MTurk introduced me some good charities. I donated 50 cents each time to ""Save the Children""
	Persuadee: Good to know. Thanks for the info, guess I am skeptical.
Persuader: I would be too, It is not easy to trust these days

7,"Persuader: Hello
	Persuadee: Hi
Persuader: So I am supposed to persuade you to donate all thirty of your cents to a charity called Save the Children
	Persuadee: Oh, I believe I've heard of them. What kind of work do they do?
Persuader: They promote childrens rights, provide relief and helps support children in developing countries
	Persuadee: Do you know if they keep track of the effectiveness of their interventions?
Persuader: I believe they do. They also help fund education for children
	Persuadee: That sounds admirable. I usually donate to global health charities (like the Against Malaria Foundation) because it's highly cost effective. Policy intervention is also important, but it's harder to know if it's worthwhile/will be successful...
Persuader: Totally understandable. It is easier to donate to something when there is tangible evidence of its success. I think helping children have access to an education will be beneficial to the entire world in the long run
	Persuadee: By the way, on my side I'm told I can donate anything from $0-$2. So donating $0.30 sounds reasonable.
Persuader: I think that is very reasonable, and every little bit helps. 
	Persuadee: I would be interested to know what different programs their funding goes towards. Do they publish a budget?
Persuader: They actually do, I just looked on their website. It has a lot of information that I didnt expect them to make public
	Persuadee: That's great! It's encouraging when a charity is transparent. I assume it's a 501.3(c)?
Persuader: It looks like it, only 5% of their donations go to management so I believe they operate as a non profit. Which is wonderful
	Persuadee: Do you have a favorite non-profit? :P
Persuader: I should probably say this one but I donate to animal shelters mainly haha
	Persuadee: Oh nice. I'd also like to look into donating more to animal welfare charities. I know there's some philosophical disagreement about this, but I prefer to diversify my charitable 'investments' as it were.
Persuader: That makes sense! So, you felt like donating 30 cents was fair?
	Persuadee: Yep! Good talking with you.",False,0.3
8,"Persuader: Hello.  Would you like to donate a portion of your reward to a charity called Save the Children?
	Persuadee: I think I would be willing to donate a portion.
Persuader: Excellent!  Would you like to know more about the charity first?
	Persuadee: Yes, that was going to be my next question.
Persuader: Save the Children promotes children's rights, and helps children from developing countries.  
	Persuadee: What types of children's rights?
Persuader: Your donation would help ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.  Many of these children live in developing or war-torn areas where these basic necessities are hard to come by. 
	Persuadee: What type of people or who manages this fund?
Persuader: Save the Children has excellent credentials and is managed by a board of commercial CEOs and business leaders without any government or religious affiliation. 
	Persuadee: Does Save the Children help children in the United States?
Persuader: Yes!  Since 1932, Save the Children has been on the ground providing support to the most isolated and underserved children in rural America.  Many of these children don't have the same opportunities as others and live in very difficult conditions.
	Persuadee: That is awesome. I work hard to help children as well.
Persuader: That's great!  It is a worthwhile cause and every penny has a significant impact on these children's lives.  Even a small donation can have a large impact in impoverished areas.
	Persuadee: I am curious why you chose the words ""rural America""?
Persuader: Of course.  I chose those words because across the United States, one in five children grows up in poverty and, of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural. Because of circumstances beyond their control, millions of kids never reach their full potential.
	Persuadee: mmmm that is interesting, I did not know that statistic.  I work with children more in an ""urban"" setting that are incredibly in bad circumstances.
Persuader: I agree that children in both settings need help and commend you for your efforts.  Admittedly, Save the Children may also have urban programs, but I drew the above information from their website, which you can find at  URL   Are you still interested in donating a portion of your reward?
	Persuadee: I am interested. I am curious if I can state if money goes to children in this country though?
Persuader: Yes, you should be able to specify that.  The researchers will use this chat to determine how much of your reward to donate and will see that you have earmarked it for Save the Children's US efforts. 
	Persuadee: That is awesome then I will donate $1.  I feel very strongly about ""our own children"" !!
Persuader: Excellent!  Thank you very much for your generous donation!",False,1.0
9,"Persuader: Children are our future, we need to do our best to ensure them grow up well. The torch of life pass on.
	Persuadee: I agree completely, if we don't take care of our future and our present our society won't have a future. People these days donate to mediocre things, I really think there should be a bigger focus on children's charity's. Personally I have met so many families who have benefited from the Ronald McDonald charity. They are provided everything that the family needs so they are able to stay close to their children. 
Persuader: How to ensure our children grow well and live well?  Our clean water, clean air and world peace, all of us connected someway. Our endless needs and wishes put our children in danger. Life really needs not much.  
	Persuadee: I think focusing on our needs as a whole community vs. just ourselves or our families is a great first step. There are so many families that are well off, and know what meal they are to have next, but they don't contribute to those who don't. This is why I donate each month. To help insure that other families in my community are provided with their basic needs. 
Persuader: Scientists put American way of life, if the whole world lives like American, it needs 7 earths. That is why there are endless fighting, we need to look at what happen to Syrian children, the Middle East.  Its fighting never end, for cheap oil? for weapon testing? 
	Persuadee: The American way of life, isn't perfect by any means. You have so many people that have way too much, and other who's children are starving and go without basic necessities. By being divided and realizing that there are issues all over the world, is what is making matters worse. We are forgetting our children, forgetting their needs, their wants, and their right to live out the life they deserve. They are getting lost in the shuffle of things. 
Persuader: The top 1% own the world and they do not share, they want our children join the army fight for their interests, protect their interest. The capitalism took over the government. Our penny donation really can not change the root of the problem since we do not have to start. We need to take our government back to work for its people, the whole world's people and share! 
	Persuadee: We can't expect the independently wealthy to understand and work for the interests of the poor. So I feel like it is our duty to donate, raise money, and work to help those around us. 
Persuader: https://support. URL ite/SPageNavigator/sponsorship.html#!/  I wish I could help everyone of the kids here.
	Persuadee: I will have to take a look and send in my donation! 
Persuader: Thank you so much! Also we need to realize just one government police change could save millions. 
	Persuadee: What do you think the change is? That is needed from the government police. 
Persuader: Policy, sorry.  Government is so important for people. 
	Persuadee: I don't understand why we can't all just get on the same page? What is the need for war? It's just boys playing army, and the children will be the ones to suffer when they are long gone. 
Persuader: Harvard Med graduate Don Berwick was pediatrician most of his life, only when he worked for Obama for 11 months, he found out all his life was saving children, not worth a policy change.
	Persuadee: I never knew that! 
Persuader: Republic did not confirm him, so he came back to MA. They also want small government, so on one protect they could rob more from the weak around the world. 
	Persuadee: The top 1% can only be the top 1% if everyone else stays poor. 
Persuader: The top 1% is control the world wealth, so they control the governments around the world. The poor countries treat them like god, the rich country lost jobs and everything else.  
	Persuadee: And unfortunatly many of the charities are run by the 1% as well. The redcross is the biggest example of this.

Persuader: We provide healthcare, education, and vocational services to children to provide an life full of opportunity and happiness. We pride ourselves in the fact that 89 cents of every dollar is spent DIRECTLY on these services.

Persuader: With just $1, we can provide food and clean water to a child for half a year.
	Persuadee: I understand. However I am sure i am not the only person donating to  your charity. My 35 cents with other peoples donations will add up

Persuader: LOL, I wish...even state school is expensive. Having kids is the worst financial decision someone can make - but I'd make that decision again ithout question. Tough getting by sometimes, but you do what you can.  
	Persuadee: I am a recent college graduate and understand the expenses with a huge loan to pay off. I graduated from a state school and can't even imagine what out of state students must feel like on top of them travelling just to study away from home.
Persuader: Good on you for getting college degree! Education is so important, they can never take that away from you. Alot of families need help with basic stuff, let alone worrying about education. My boys did alot of service type stuff with underprivileged kids when they were younger.
	Persuadee: Thanks! I had a lot of parental support as they always wanted a degree themselves but put their children first. I wish I did more service during my undergrad but had a credit-intensive major (chemistry) and barely had any summer vacation.
Persuader: Chemistry is black magic to me, my older son is a whiz at it. When they were scouts they did service for Save the Children. Have you ever heard of it?
	Persuadee: I was approached to chemistry at a young age and it just was easy to pick up...that is until physical chemistry came along. And yes! I've donated to them before. There's even a small kiosk at my local mall.
Persuader: They do great work. It's amazing how far they can stretch even a little bit of change. Would you consider donating part of your payment for this task to them?
	Persuadee: Yes, of course! I don't mind giving half the amount.
Persuader: That's great! I'll do the same.
	Persuadee: I forget what the Save The Children donation rate is, but I'm sure $1 will help a lot.
Persuader: Absolutely. I like to think of it as an investment in the future.
	Persuadee: My younger brother (still in HS) actually recommended me to donate to them in the past. His school had a special presentation on charaties. I forget the name of the really popular one where kids used to carry around small cardboard boxes and ask for change. 
Persuader: I think that was UNICEF. I remember that from more than a few years ago.

	Persuadee: I don't know. What is the fund for?
Persuader: The funds are used to promote children's rights and well-being in developing countries
	Persuadee: What kind of well-being?
Persuader: It provides medical needs, education. And in some cases, relief in war torn areas
	Persuadee: Oh that sounds good. Who runs it?
Persuader: It was founded in 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb  in London, in the wake of World War I. It soon becomes the first global movement for children. It is ran by a Board of Trustees
	Persuadee: Oh. Well, I don't know if it can be trusted or not to send the funds to the right place?
Persuader: Our independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. We keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.
	Persuadee: That's good. I like charities that don't have high administrative costs. Do you work for the organization?
Persuader: I volunteer after noticing how much wasteful I was with the pennies. They can use every little they can get
	Persuadee: Okay. I don't even understand what that means. 
Persuader: Imagine how you spend those pennies laying around. You can use those to donate to Save the Children
	Persuadee: I see. That is a good thought, but I'm not usually very wasteful with my money, even my pennies. Every penny counts after all.
Persuader: That's great to hear. How about putting some that to use today. I guarantee a $1.50 to Save the Children will actually give you a great feeling of satisfaction  
	Persuadee: Would I get to designate what country it gets spent in or on what project?
Persuader: All projects and audit reports are listed for the public. So you'd be able to see how the money is used
	Persuadee: I know. But would I get to indicate a preference of where or how I want it spent?
Persuader: Yes! If you chose the option to sponsor a child

	Persuadee: Yes I am aware. I have donated to them in the past. I feel so sorry for the children. And I think that people who donate are doing great things
Persuader: Exactly! Now I plan on donating at least half of my $2 payment. Meaning $1.

	Persuadee: That is a wonderful thing that there doing 
Persuader: Yeah, it really is. I always try to donate when I can. Even at the grocery store when they ask if I want to donate to various charities. 
	Persuadee: Yep me too especially during xmas time. I wish i could donate more but maybe this year i will donate my  time and money
Persuader: I will always donate at least a dollar. If I\'m spending my last few dollars, at that time, I can ""afford"" a dollar to someone who can not if the charity is legit.
	Persuadee: Yeah a dollar would be great
Persuader: We have to have three more back and forth ""chats"" for you and I to get paid AND the charity to get paid.

	Persuadee: A dollar is fine by me

	Persuadee: Hey hows it? Yeah I am interested to hear more.
Persuader: When you give to Save the Children, you're investing in a future for every last child.Nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to our mission _ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe. 
	Persuadee: Nearly 90?  Where does the other money go?
Persuader: The rest? We use to support the mission _ running our programs and raising funds to help more children. 
	Persuadee: Well that is good.  I like that information out there.
Persuader:  Giving to Save the Children is one of the world's best investments. Changing children's lives now. Transforming the future we all share.
	Persuadee: There are many charities for children than just that one.
Persuader: In 2017 alone, Save the Children reached more than 155 million children in 120 countries, including the U.S.  Results like these are only possible because of giving people like you. Whether you give a little or a lot. Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.
	Persuadee: Wow thats way more than I would have thought.
Persuader: I know, it is a really great organization. Do you think you'd be willing to donate today?
	Persuadee: Yes I would be willing to donate.
Persuader: How about $.15 today?
	Persuadee: I can do that
Persuader: Awesome, you are making a world of difference for children around the world. 
	Persuadee: Well it is not much but if everyone would give a little it would make a huge difference in this world we live in.
Persuader: You're absolutely right. Most people would not even notice the money missing. 
	Persuadee: Right on so I will give $0.15  :)
Persuader: I will match your contribution.

	Persuadee: I am quite good. How about yourself? 
Persuader: I am doing absolutely wonderful! Do you have any children or nieces\\nephews?  
	Persuadee: I have none of the above. Do you? 
Persuader: I do I just had a beautiful little baby girl. She is now 1 month old. 
	Persuadee: That's wonderful.  Congratulations. I would like to come back to that if there is enough time. What social issue are we supposed to be discussing? I don't see that information anywhere. 
Persuader: I was just leading into that. To be honest I could never imaging if anything happened to my daughter. And there are some non governmental organizations out there that help children like my daughter who are in trouble in developing countries. Would you like to know more about this organization?
	Persuadee: Of course. 
Persuader: This organization is called Save the Children. They provide relief and help support any child in need in developing countries. They go where they are needed. Personally I think this organization is needed especially being a new father I know how vulnerable children are now. And sometimes they just need help. 
	Persuadee: Sounds like a noble cause, for sure. People need as much help as they can raising a child, I think. 
Persuader: Absolutely! I can attest to that! Organizations like this primarily operate off of donations. Have ever contributed to non profit organizations?
	Persuadee: Indeed I have. I do it as much as I can, which is admittedly not as much as I would like to. 
Persuader: I know what you mean! sometimes it is hard to find the extra time or money to help those that need it. 
	Persuadee: Definitely. If I wasn't worrying about getting by so much myself, I would be able to do much more. It's very rewarding. Gives you a great feeling inside. 
Persuader: Would you be willing to entertain the idea of donating some or all of the 2 dollar bonus received by completing this hit?
	Persuadee: I would prefer to keep the bonus this time, given how bad my finances are at the moment. I'm sure you understand. 
Persuader: I absolutely do. Even the smallest amount would go a long way in helping this organization. I was thinking of doing even .15 of my bonus to this organization. That way I still get a majority of my bonus and hopefully others will donate as well so those tiny amounts add up so something of value for Save the Children.
	Persuadee: Well, to tel you the truth, there is another reason I don't want to do it.  I like to vet charities extensively before I donate to them. As a result, I have a preferred list of charities that I give to regularly. I don't have time to properly vet this one at the moment. 
Persuader: That is understandable. My thought is its only .15 of my bonus and it would take more time to vet the organization then the donation is worth. Sometimes you have to go with that gut feeling and looking at my daughter sleeping right now I do not want any child to go without help that needs it. 
	Persuadee: I'm just not interested, especially given the amount of time we spent on this hit, I think we should get more.

Persuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. They do amazing work in places where children do not have advocates for their well-being.
	Persuadee: That sounds awesome. That's the sort of charity I would gladly donate to. They seem to be really making a difference in the world
Persuader: You rock! Save the Children ensures that children have a right to health, education, and safety. For example: Syria in the first two months of 2018 In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000+ children were killed or severely injured in violent situations. It is incredibly unfair to these children to experience such trauma at a young age, and thats where Save the Children steps in to help.
	Persuadee: What are some things Save the Children have done for those children? 
Persuader: In 2017, the charity reached 155 million children in the U.S. and worldwide. Would you like to know more about how the charity has stopped infectious diseases, lowered newborn fatality, stopped childhood hunger, provided education or provided disaster relief?
	Persuadee: yes please 
Persuader: To start, In the past three years the charity has treated more than 538,000 cases of pneumonia alone
	Persuadee: oh that's great!
Persuader: Next, Save the Children has provided food for more than 4.4 million children in the past year helping to reduce world hunger
	Persuadee: that's great too. very important
Persuader: Also, around the world, nearly 400 million school-age children can't read or write. With the program instituted by the charity the literacy rates have been shown to increase by 30% and the children are 50% more likely to reach the 6th grade.

Persuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: These sound like serious problems. Have you ever donated money to this organization? Have you ever volunteered for them?
Persuader: I have donated to this organization through HITs, but I do not have enough free time to be volunteered in person. I read about them and they are clear with their financial reports.
	Persuadee: I am reluctant to donate to charities because I don't know  how efficiently they use their money.
Persuader: I think you're right I can't trust every charity, but some big companies cooperate with them like Disney and IKEA. and donating did not hurt the reward of the HIT so I did not lose anything anyway

	Persuadee: United States. I think it's a good cause but I would need more information about it before contributing a lot of money. I'd want to know what exactly they do and how they help the kids, how the money is distributed, how they select the children, etc.
Persuader: I totally get it.  It's non-government at least.  Last year they helped kids in Bangladesh who were refugees.  I think they see where there is a need and step in - so larger groups of children.
	Persuadee: What type of help do they offer? Shelter, food, medical supplies, education, relocation?
Persuader: Shelter, food, hygiene, water, even training for how to take care of themselves.  It's the type of thing where you could give a little (or a lot) at one time, or sponsor a child, or do a one time give that supplies them with food or water or hygiene for a certain amount of time.  Lots of options...

Persuader: Fourteen percent is fundraising and management - so 86% goes to the kids.  That's pretty good!

Persuader: Our family sponsors a child, and it gives us a good sense of ""giving back"".  It\'s why I asked where you are from.  I feel like in America we have so much!!!  It feels like we are helping more than ourselves and the people around us when we give internationally.

Persuader: Sorry I hit the return button instead of the ' button last time...  We attend church too, and it's another reason why we want to give - I mean it reminds us of how much we've been given.  Do you have any desire to give to this Save the Children organization? It could even just be the donation of this HIT...
	Persuadee: Not at this time because I don't have a job currently; that's the reason I didn't get involved in our church drive since I'm having a difficult time paying my own bills. As soon as I get back on my feet I'll look it up.

Persuader: I'd like to chat with you about a children's charity today. Do you have a moment?

Persuader: Some people are born really well-off. Some are born not well-off, but they can reasonably expect enough food to eat and a place to live. And there are some who are born so destitute that they can go for several weeks in hunger and/or not have a safe place to live or sleep. How does that make you feel?

Persuader: They even help kids in other countries who have little food. It really is a shame that we have so much food in this country but so many can go hungry

Persuader: Another thing about this charity is that a small amount of money goes a long way. For you $2 dollars could buy one meal, but for a refugee child 77 cents could make the difference of safety. 77 cents a day can provide shelter to a refugee family.

	Persuadee: No, sorry.
Persuader: Anything would be welcome and helpful, the charity is essential to ensuring children's rights to healthcare, education, safety, and more. Even something as little as 10 cents would be beneficial to helping a child in need.
	Persuadee: No, I apologize.  
Persuader: Can I ask why you are hesitant to make a donation?
	Persuadee: I already make numerous donations throughout the year.
Persuader: That's wonderful to hear, however there is no limit to charitable acts. A small amount goes a long way, this donation would most likely go to helping the 1 million Rohingya refugees that are fleeing for their lives in Myanmar and Bangladesh. 
	Persuadee: No, thank you for asking though.
Persuader: I wouldn't keep asking if it was not for the importance of the situation. I believe that each of us is part of the solution, and your donation would serve to help those in need.
	Persuadee: I think its great you are fundraising, however, my answer is still no.
Persuader: Millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence that would greatly benefit from any sort of help. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. A small donation of mere cents can address these deadly problems.
	Persuadee: That is unfortunate.  I've already given my answer of no and do not appreciate you being so pushy. 
Persuader: I apologize for my pushiness, however I still urge you to think about your position in relation to those in need. If you are not able or willing to make a small donation, would you be willing to learn more about the organization and its work?

Persuader: I am fairly familiar with them. They are an international organization that promotes children's rights and provides relief and support. I think they do great work for the children of the world.
	Persuadee: It sounds like a great organization. I think helping children is very important
Persuader: Me, too. I see a lot of images on tv and on the internet of children suffering because of lack of resources and aid and it breaks my heart. I don't have a lot but I try to do what I can to help.
	Persuadee: It breaks my heart too. I can't watch or look at those images. What can people do to help?
Persuader: A charity like Save the Children relies on donations. They are non-governmental so all their funding comes from those willing to donate. I try to donate when I can. 
	Persuadee: Do you think the donations go mainly to the children or are there a lot of administrative fees that it goes to first?
Persuader: With Save the Children I trust that the money goes to the children. Other charities you have to watch out for but I've heard nothing but good about Save the Children. I never know how much to donate though. I want to help as much as I can, and even sometimes just a few dollars helps. How do you feel about donation amounts?
	Persuadee: I never know how much to donate either or how to donate
Persuader: I often donate some of my earnings here. For example, I might use some of what I make today as a donation, especially from this HIT since it's what we're discussing. I tend to feel guilty if I talk positively about something and then don't follow through.
	Persuadee: That would be great if we could do that here. Now that we are talking about it, I feel like I should do something to help more often
Persuader: We are allowed to donate some of this HIT to Save the Children if we want. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. Would you be willing to donate $1 or more from this HIT?

Persuader: That's great. I'll donate $1, too.

Persuader: That's great. They are definitely a worthy charity and do so much good. I appreciate you hearing me out and taking the time to research more.

	Persuadee: It's a nonprofit, thats about it. Why?,
Persuader: I think it's a rather important topic of discussion mainly because there are so many children dying of hunger each day. 
	Persuadee: You're not wrong about that, at all. It's disturbing. 
Persuader: Absolutely! I think most people don't trust these organizations because they believe them to be untrustworthy in regards to donations. This nonprofit is actually trustworthy from what I can see.
	Persuadee: My issue with many is that they tend to use more of their donations to cover their ""overhead"" then to actually help the cause they claim to support. I research before I donate, generally speaking
Persuader: Very understandable. I tend to research before investing time or money into any endeavor to be honest. For instance, with the Save the Children org, I've read that they've been contributing support and giving aid to children in developing countries that severely need it. Truly a noble cause.
	Persuadee: I completely agree. 
Persuader: Are you familiar with the situation in Syria currently? 
	Persuadee: Yes, very much. Syria has been devestated
Persuader: To be more specific, there are millions of Syrian children currently that are facing threats of violence daily. 1,000 children have been killed or injured just in the first few months of 2018. 
	Persuadee: Correct. I donate to UNICEF on a fairly frequent basis to help.

Persuader: Absolutely. Do some quick research on them--they're rated 97 out of 100 for transparency and accountability by Charity Navigator. That might be the best I've ever seen! The kids certainly need the help. You have the opportunity to donate a portion of your task payment to Save the Children when we wrap up our conversation. Any little bit helps.
	Persuadee: I would love to - will it prompt me when the conversation is over? Or should I tell you the amount?
Persuader: Oh no you don't have to tell me anything, you'll have the opportunity when we wrap up here. Beyond our conversation, certainly give them a look.

Persuader: It certainly makes things easy. It helps when the charity in question has been around for a hundred years and their chief focus is to enforce rights of the child and engage in policy change that benefits children directly. Have you ever donated to a similar cause?
	Persuadee: I have! When the Syrian crisis was really heating up I remember giving to a campaign to help the families over there. I'm so sad that it's still going on and the suffering has not ended
Persuader: It hasn't yet ended, but it appears overall that things are slowly headed in the right direction. It's important we continue to engage
