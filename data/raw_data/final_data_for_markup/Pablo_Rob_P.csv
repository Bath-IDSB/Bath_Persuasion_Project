	Persuadee: No, no subject has been shown
Persuader: I am reading my role right now. This is fun.
	Persuadee: What is your role and why do you think it's fun?
Persuader: It's my first time doing this type of assignment here.
	Persuadee: I've never done anything like this either.
Persuader: Tell me, do you usually get involved with organizations that you trust and try to make a difference in the world by cooperating with the service these organizations offer?
	Persuadee: Yes, I do a pretty good amount of volunteer work. I mostly offer my time and services as opposed to money.
Persuader: Oh, just like me!
	Persuadee: What types of organizations are you involved in?
Persuader: Mostly the ones that help children. I think offering time instead of money is the best thing to do. Giving money sounds like the easiest way to go and it doesn't require too much dedication or involvement. But when the organization is located far from where I live, I donate money. How about you? 
	Persuadee: I don't like to donate money unless I know exactly where the money is going. I don't want to pay for administrative bonuses and vacations or things like that. 
Persuader: Have you heard of Save the Children? They are a trustful organization, they publish all the financial information on their website for all to see, and they make sure that the donations are used in the most cost-effective ways possible. Would you be willing to donate to this organization your compensation on this task?
	Persuadee: That is a charitable organization I have heard a lot about. The compensation for this is only $2.00 and, I guess, I can afford to donate that. I can only hope that even this small amount of money will DIRECTLY help children and no line some the pocket of some unscrupulous person.
Persuader: I took a look in their annual report and I like what I see. I am convinced they make sure the money goes directly to the kids needs. And they have been helping 157 million children in 120 countries --not a small task. And I am sure they can appreciate even $2.00, for any penny can make a difference. I am willing to donate too. So, do you agree to donate? 
	Persuadee: Yes, I will give my $2.00 payment to Save The Children and take the gamble that it helps someone.
Persuader: That's the first time I hear from them, but just by looking their website I can tell they are trustworthy. Have you seen the website?  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report 
	Persuadee: No, I wouldn't do that type of research on line because, again, it's hard to know what to trust. It could be a fake website or it could be a real website with fax statistics. That is why I usually prefer to give money directly to the cause of my choice.
Persuader: I am happy to see that they help children all over the world, being 12% of the donations directed to children in the US.

Persuader: 88% of donations goes towards programs and services.  as an individual donor you can choose a child to sponsor
	Persuadee: that sounds like a good idea could i get to write to the child or talk to them?
Persuader: yes, you would be given a welcome kit which would include a photo and contact info on the child
	Persuadee: what else would be done to help the children? will there be a way to video chat with them?
Persuader: you can't video chat with them but you would receive video updates on how they are doing.  Would you like to donate $1 today

Our website offers much education to the public about living conditions and the negative things that affect these innocent children.

Persuader: Exactly! Most people spend countless amounts of money on wasted product or food when something as small as $1.00 can benefit one of these children. Did you know that in the first two months of this year, 1,000 children were reported killed or injured in Syria. That's so heartbreaking and it angers me. How does it make you feel?

Persuader: Yeah, it's super cool! Even a small donation of 50 cents is great when lots of other people are donating too. Would you be interested in donating some of your task earnings?

	Persuadee: I think I've heard about it.
Persuader: Well it's a great charity that puts a lot of time and effort into taking care of children's health, education and safety.
	Persuadee: Is it international? Is it tax deductible?
Persuader: It is tax deductible, and it is currently in 120 countries which is very impressive for an organization that has taken on so many different initiatives.
	Persuadee: What kinds of things do they do? Is it like adopt a child type thing? 
Persuader: They do everything from build schools (including the hiring/training of teachers), to building hospitals and funding supplies/programs for them, to programs that aid in getting food/clothing to children in countries where they have no access to such things - and recently they've even pushed into childhood cancer and funding medication and research in lesser-developed countries.
	Persuadee: Wow. That is impressive. Do you work for them?
Persuader: I don't, I'm just here to see if you'd consider donating any amount to the organization today. The funds go towards sponsoring a child or service and I think it would be a great way to give back to the world. 
	Persuadee: It does seem worthwhile. How much of my money goes to the charity though? I don't want it all going to administrative costs and paying some CEO.
Persuader: Oh, I totally agree with you on that. I feel the same exact way. The breakdown for Save the Children for the year 2017 was 86% went to programming, 9% fundraising and 5% went to management and general.
	Persuadee: That sounds good. Glad to hear it. I wouldn't mind giving something. Can I choose what program it goes to?
Persuader: Unfortunately they don't have that flexibility for me to be able to do that - but what amount are you thinking of donating?

	Persuadee: Hello, great and you?
Persuader: Very good. I've been hearing about this charity called Save the Children, and I'm consistently amazed at what wonderful work they do.
	Persuadee: Yeah? well, tell me more about the charity
Persuader: Save the children is a Non-governmental organization, meaning it's independent. It promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: What kind of countries? and What types of actions you make for the childrens?
Persuader: Developing countries are places where the government isn't as strong, and many people live in poverty, so lots of things go unchecked that would be taken care of in more developed countries. It's important to have an independent organization look out for kids in those countries. Children are routinely treated in ways that are very bad in developing countries.
	Persuadee: that sounds terrible, and how you help them been in other country?
Persuader: We give them medical checkups. Many children in those countries have no routine access to healthcare, so they suffer from diseases like vitamin deficiency. We also help shine the light on abuse to help get them out of abusive situations.
	Persuadee: That sounds very good, I've a friend that is from a foreign country and they're in a bad situation in that place, so I think it's very important to help them in anyway we can
Persuader: Yes. Recently Save the Children helped rescue a child who was dying from hunger in one such country. They also helped relocate many children who were orphaned by Syrian Civil War. Many tragic things happen but Save the Children helps children when no one else seems to care or be capable.
	Persuadee: Save the Children sounds amazing, so, please let me know, it's there anyway one can contribute or participate for the cause?
Persuader: Yes, you can. I donated as much as I possibly could and Save the Children told me that I helped save the lives of several children by giving them food and medical care. It really warmed my heart! I'd donate everything I had to them if I could.
	Persuadee: That sounds amazing, and they've some webpage or some kind of way that you can see all the process that they made to help the children? I really want to know about the project in general
Persuader: Yes, their website is  URL  Read through it and be sure to donate the maximum amount! The more kids saved the better!
	Persuadee: Alright! Sure would do, thank you so much for all the information, you're a great person!
Persuader: Your welcome! Also I think you'll like to hear that Save the Children was named as one of the ten most accountable charities in a recent study. They don't waste much on overhead. The head of the charity drives a 15 year old car!
	Persuadee: Well, that says a lot about the people behind the charity! The webpage looks very good and legit too
Persuader: Yes, it's pretty legit. I'd say it's one of the most legit charities out there. They regularly make sure that the whole organization is audited. You can see where all the money goes in their reports. A lot of time and effort is spent in the third world countries and so every dollar you spend goes a long way.
	Persuadee: That's exactly what I want to hear! that's it's my major concern with charities in general, to be honest, so tell me, it's something I can donated here right now?
Persuader: Yes, you can donate the maximum amount immediately.

For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Your donation can address such problems.
	Persuadee: Oh wow, shocking news. Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?

Persuader: Save the Children is a charitable organization that promotes children's rights. They also provide relief for children in regions subject to violence and civil unrest, and aid for needy children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: How did you learn about them?
Persuader: I originally found out about them when someone talked to me about donating to them. Most of what I know about them comes from reading about them online.
	Persuadee: What countries do they help in?
Persuader: They help children in 120 different countries, including the USA and most African, South American, and Asian countries.
	Persuadee: Are donations made securely and safely?
Persuader: They are. Save the Children is a very highly rated charity, rated 88.3 out of 100 by Charity Navigator in 2016. They also disclose all of their financial information online, to promote transparency in how they spend the money donated to them.
	Persuadee: How much of the donation goes to the child?
Persuader: 86% of donations go into programs to help children. Administrative costs are only about 5% of donations, with the remainder going towards fundraising efforts.
	Persuadee: Is that a good amount? How much can I donate?
Persuader: 5% is a rather low administrative cost for a charity, which is good. And the portion that goes to fundraising generates more donations than the money put into it, so it overall increases the money that gets to those who need it. And any donation helps, even something as low as one or two dollars.
	Persuadee: What can one to two dollars buy for a child in need?
Persuader: It depends of course on the region where the child being helped is located. But in some of the poorer parts of the world, a dollar can buy a few days worth of healthy food, or buy an item of clothing for a child who needs it.

Persuader: Oh good.but first, do you have any idea or opinion on your mind of like other way of helping street children or lets just say homeless children?
	Persuadee: Well, one can provide food for children on the street, for example, buy them food and home them by finding shelters nearby 
Persuader: ve the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Do you have any idea how it be possible to do your idea? You by yourself are you willing to help some needy children too?

Persuader: That's great!  We should all do something to help.  Not only are these kids hungry but they are exposed to so much violence.  Millions of kids in Syria grow up facing the daily threat of violence.
	Persuadee: I agree! It's heartbreaking to see some of the images in the news involving children from around the world
Persuader: Also, they help kids in the United State. Across the United States, one in five children grows up in poverty. Of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural. Because of circumstances beyond their control, millions of kids never reach their full potential.

Persuader: Yeah, it is great.  They actually helped 237,000 children just in the United States last year so they really try to help everywhere they can.  They are also one of the organizations that really puts donations to good work, instead of in the pockets of administrators

Persuader: One thing they do is build shelters sothey havea place to live.   That alone is a near miracle for so many of these kids.  Hey,  check this site out  URL

Persuader: Gh ets the first step for a charity likethis.  When kids are fed and sheltered theyare healthy.  That lets them learn.  So,  Save The Children had literacy and learning programs they use with the kids
	Persuadee: That's great. It sounds similar to an organization I've been donating to for over a decade. Have you ever heard of Compassion International?
Persuader: Yes!  I considered a child through them for several years.  I used to send him Christmas presents and such aloooong with monthly donations.   The two charities are very similar
	Persuadee: That's wonderful. I actually sponsor three children through them now. Two years ago I was able to go and visit one of the girls I sponsor in Peru. It was the most surreal experience and made it so much more real seeing how my money had helped her life. I also got to see firsthand what the organization does with the children. 
Persuader: That is awesome!  Experiences like that are great for the giver and the kids.   It's sad t_ see what they have to deal with even after help, many times.  You've seen this first hand so you probably wouldn't have any problem with giving STC 0.50 from the hit payment,  right?
	Persuadee: Sure, I can give 0.50 to the save the children organization.

Persuader: I would be glad to. Every day, 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, mostly from preventable causes. This charity puts a focus on this under 5, at-risk group. Just a small donation would go towards vaccinating kids the world over.
