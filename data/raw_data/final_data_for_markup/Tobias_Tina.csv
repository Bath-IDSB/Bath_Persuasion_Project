	Persuadee: not too bad yours?
Persuader: Good so far, been busy with HITs this morning which is a nice change for the usual weekend lull of HITs

Persuader: They help kids all over the globe in dire situations by providing relief and aid to them, they're pretty awesome!
	Persuadee: have you ever donated to them?
Persuader: I have a few times, through this HIT actually. At the end the researchers let us donate any amount of our task payment directly to the organization.
	Persuadee: how much have you donated? I mean I can only afford a little otherwise I wouldn't be doing HITS...;)
Persuader: I usually donate just a small amount between like 10 and 30 cents, even just a small amount makes a big difference because there are so many of us each helping a small amount.
	Persuadee: sounds like a good idea, you think $.10 is good enough?
Persuader: It most certainly is - every bit is appreciated! The kids will benefit greatly from this as the researchers have been doing hundreds of HITs so it really does add up when everyone donates a small amount.
	Persuadee: are you going to donate?
Persuader: I'm going to donate $.30 - today has been a good day for HITs so it won't kill me heh. And just think how many other pairs of people are making the same decision! 
	Persuadee: I know I hope the researchers raise a lot of money through this...
Persuader: It'd be cool if they showed us at the end of the study how much has been raised so far, I'd really like that.

Persuader: How much would you be willing to donate to a children's charity?
	Persuadee: Everything I could, if it was the right charity, I believe in helping needy children but don't like donating to charities that keep more of the proceeds than they donate.
Persuader: The charity I am talking about is ""Save the children."" Your donation helps with children\'s right to health, education. This isn\'t like a guy on your TV next to impoverished children. They really are making a difference.
	Persuadee: That\'s good, I\'ve heard good things about ""Save the Children"". I\'d donate my whole $2 to them.
Persuader: Wow! That's great news! Your proceeds will help children in need all around the world!
	Persuadee: That's is pretty cool. I really feel it's every able persons responsibility to help make sure that less fortunate children have the same resources and available opportunities as the more fortunate ones.
Persuader: I totally agree! Can you state as your last statement how much you are willing to donate so they can make sure they have the correct amount? Have a great day!
	Persuadee: Sure, I am willing to donate the whole $2 to ""Save the Children"".

	Persuadee: Well, talking about children's charities is pretty interesting. We keep talking for a bit and eventually they button pops up. 
Persuader: Yeah sounds great! I was actually adopted from Thailand by Holt. I highly recommend them also.
	Persuadee: Holt? Is that a children's charity? I've never heard of them.
Persuader: Yes they are. There were started during the Korean war and the couple were saving orphans from the war. I donate to Holt every year.
	Persuadee: Wow, it sounds like a charity my husband and I will have to investigate. We like to donate through our church to various charities and they're always looking for something new.
Persuader: They are great since they help orphans and they also get children adopted. They are in most third world countries.
	Persuadee: Interesting, do they solicit donations or is a word of mouth charity? I ask because if they solicit they usually have a web page and a brochure for people to look over.
Persuader: They are based out of Washington state. I usually get mail from them and you can sponsor particular children and get quarterly updates.
	Persuadee: Nice, I\'ll look in to it. Anyway back to the ""Save the Children"" charity I\'ll definitely donate my $2 to them for sure.",False,2.0
850,"Persuader: How would you like to donate to Save the Children, a wonderful charity that helps children with health, education and your donation can make a big difference!
	Persuadee: That sounds interesting but can you tell me more?
Persuader: Often children have a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
	Persuadee: Where is the charity headquartered?
Persuader: 501 Kings Highway East, Suite 400 Fairfield, CT 06825, if that helps.
	Persuadee: Please forgive me for the questions but I have to ask as I have been scammed by so called charities before.  How many children do you help?
Persuader: I completely understand and it is hard to know in today's world, we have helped 155 million children to this day!
	Persuadee: That sounds like a lot! Wow!  Last year I got victimized by a Nigerian scam helping a so-called Nigerian Prince's legal fund who had been imprisoned and persecuted for being homosexual.
Persuader:  77 cents of your dollar goes to the children will the rest goes to operation costs. So how much would you like to donate?
	Persuadee: How much are you looking for?
Persuader: The average donation is around $2.00 dollars.
	Persuadee: That is a respectable request.  I live on SSI and don't make much. Thank you for letting me know how much of my money actually goes to the children. I was just about to ask that.  How can I donate the $2.00?  Check/Credit Card/Pay Pal?
Persuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.
	Persuadee: Oh ok. Is it tax deductible do you know?
Persuader: Yes it is.
	Persuadee: Will I get a picture and/or a letter from the child I am helping?
Persuader: I think that is only for large and monthly donations, however I will even match your donation in whatever you give.
	Persuadee: I would be happy to donate to Save the Children!

Persuader: No, honestly I don't but I would feel like my money would go to a good cause if I were to 
	Persuadee: I appreciate your honesty
Persuader: We could all do better, I suppose. These organizations only ask for a small amount that we may spend on coffee each day or snacks we don't need.
	Persuadee: I hear you. I do believe in donations, but my only worry is that the money doesn't go to where I think it is going. I prefer to volunteer is I can
Persuader: That's a good idea actually, that way you know for sure your efforts are helping.
	Persuadee: But the places I do donate are often revolved around helping children, so this is a great organization
Persuader: It only takes pocket change for us to help out. 
	Persuadee: I agree. you never know who you could be helping
Persuader: Do your family or friends donate to such causes?
	Persuadee: We do. My mom is on the board for a few nonprofits that we attend fundraisers for. That is a great way to raise money
Persuader: Wow.  Well you've seen charity first-hand.
	Persuadee: Yes, I try to help as much as I can, but it's hard when you are broke
Persuader: I definitely understand.  Sometimes it's more a matter of convenience, too.  It doesn't take much to save 30c a week or something.
	Persuadee: that is true, but its hard to justify that 30c is going to make any difference

Persuader: No, I am not. But once in a while i like to help the needy ones and especially children.

	Persuadee: Yeah, exactly. ""Save the children"" is pretty vague, too, haha.
Persuader: Yep, they gave me all kinds of tactics to use on you that I didn't want to like asking how much you spend on things like candy LOL
	Persuadee: Haha! That's interesting. What other tactics did they suggest?
Persuader: They said to tell you that you are part of the solution and that you have a moral responsibility to help
	Persuadee: Well, true, but I also have a moral responsibility to my family. I feel worse when cashiers ask me. It seems to happen so frequently now.

	Persuadee: Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.  I do the same for World Vision.  I sponsor 3 children.
Persuader: That's amazing.  When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.  We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.  So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.   
	Persuadee: I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.  Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.  How long have you been donating?
Persuader: For years.  I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.  You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.  Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.  I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.  
	Persuadee: That is good.  I've heard good things about Save the Children.  I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.  I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.  I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.
Persuader: Absolutely. We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.  You know what, you've encouraged me.  I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.  You want to join me?  It won't be much but every penny counts.  We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.  
	Persuadee: Sure.  I would love to help.  I would love to make a donation today.
Persuader: That's amazing.  Should we give our whole 30 cents?  It's not like either of us can do much with that either.
	Persuadee: Probably more.  Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?
Persuader: I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.  Hassle free.  
	Persuadee: Ok, sounds good.  I'll donate the whole amount.
Persuader: I'm so glad I got partnered with you.  With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.

Persuader: Let me ask you this, do you have children?
	Persuadee: Yes, I have one child. He's four.
Persuader: Perfect. Now I want you to imagine how your child's life would be if he was alone, bouncing from foster home to foster home. Imagine him with no strong mentor or leader in his life. How does that make you feel?
	Persuadee: I would suppose that it would be a rough life, but even if I did want to donate to a children's charity specifically, why would I choose yours out of all of them?
Persuader: You should pick my charity because we pride ourselves on transparency. If you were to give me $0.50 today I could tell you exactly where all the money was to go. You want to know where? It's going straight into a college fund for a foster child. 
	Persuadee: If I did decide to donate to you, what would the average donation be? 
Persuader: The average donation is 25 cents to 50 cents. Anything helps
	Persuadee: Well, I think I would like to send a donation, but first I still want to know a little bit more. Does every single penny go towards the foster children or does the donation company keep a percentage of the profits?
Persuader: For all of our donations from individuals, 100% of the proceeds go to the child. The charity runs from larger donations from corporations. 
	Persuadee: That's good to hear, I'm feeling more inclined to donate now, but could you first tell me more about who runs the charity operations? or if there's any other uses that this money will go towards outside of college funds?
Persuader: The charity has a dedicated operations team that has been running the ship for over a decade now. We do take donations for things other than college funds, including: food donations, clothing etc. I just work on the college team
	Persuadee: That's fair, well, I guess that it wouldn't hurt to give some money to your charity. How do I go about doing that?
Persuader: It's pretty easy, the donation can be deducted from your task payment. 
	Persuadee: Alright, well, once we've finished up here then I will be sure to do that.

Maybe just this once, would you be willing to donate 10 cents of your hit?  That would leave you $1.90 and a child can be blessed because of just 10 cents.

	Persuadee: Homeless shelters, food pantries, environmental stuff.  Poor people I see on the street.
Persuader: That's great and very worthy causes. I know it is not easy to donate when you have no extra money. I also donate to food pantries and have passed out many sandwiches and drinks to the homeless. I even made a sleeping bag out of grocery sacks, it was waterproof so the guy gave it to could sleep off of the wet ground. Are you sure you would not be willing to just give 10 cents for a child?

	Persuadee: How much can they really do with a couple of bucks though?
Persuader: They can feed entire camps with several couple dollars! That's how they're funded! They get running water and electricity to children that need it.  Just a few bucks adds up when its coming from a couple of people, you know?
	Persuadee: I guess so.  Seems they have many supporters, makes me feel like mine drop in the bucket is meaningless.
Persuader: I don't think so at all. It makes you a contributor to a wonderful cause, not a drop in a bucket! If a few bucks was the difference between getting child(ren) out of a hostile living environment and into one more stable, wouldn't that mean something to you? That definitely could be the case. It's not meaningless. It's a valued contribution.
	Persuadee: I would possibly donate at some point
Persuader: That's great to hear and you have the perfect opportunity right now. 
	Persuadee: I want to be able to give more than $2.  I will consider giving in the future.  
Persuader: You could give the $2 from chatting with me about this cause and donate again - by any one of those means that I mentioned above in any amount that you are satisfied with.  It's free money going to a good cause and it all gets taken care of directly from here. 
	Persuadee: I prefer to give directly through the website.  I am here to make money.

Although I agree that charities like the Save the Children are important just like children/people of developing countries are important, there are A LOT of children in the U.S. that are in major need of help. I understand that there is a difference but there are a lot of starving children here too that need just as much help.
Persuader: there are indeed a lot of people here that need help as well, but those people here have better access to government and private services and programs, most people in developing countries do not, in the books ive read lots of children beg for MREs and bottles of water from soldiers, id like to never have to read about that in another military biography, don't you agree?
	Persuadee: I do agree. I also agree that people here have better access to gov't assistance. That being said, as a foster parent, it is my experience that children here starve, too. Not that I am saying I don't want to help anyone outside of this country. I have and will again.

Persuader: I gave what was given to me . Over the next few chats I'm going to tell you the story of Bruce a child that like alot of these chidren need help but threw Save The Chidren found it. At the end Of our next few chats I'm going to ask you to  donate what you earn from this survey . I want you to think about what it means to save a child thats in trouble and how by saving that child you find new hope in your own life.
	Persuadee: I'm certainly willing to listen. Tell me about Bruce.
Persuader: Bruce was born to a single mother who was only 14 at the time he came into this world , the girls mother and father were ashamed of her pregnancy and kicked out of the house. Bruce was born and taken from the girl because she was to young to raise him and her was adobted out to a poor family that did their best to provide for him . The founder of save the children heard about the family and learned of Bruces story . He came to meet Bruce .
	Persuadee: That poor girl, being rejected by her own family like that. I'm glad that Bruce was taken in, though. How did the visit go?
Persuader: The owner got involved in Bruces life and sav the children went to work and provide food and cloths and school needs for Bruce . Bruce went own to join the save the children foundation after he completed college and is helping save children today. 
	Persuadee: That's awesome! He even made it through college. I can see how he'd be really devoted to the organization, given the impact they had on his life.
Persuader: Yes he is a force for good and was saved out of tragedy.
	Persuadee: If only all kids were so lucky. But I guess it takes a lot of work to try to help the ones who need it most
Persuader: Now I would Like to ask you to donate what you about to receive and and give to other in need. Yiur will go to help other just like that right now are looking or in room by themselves hoping for a miracle .Will you be that miracle and help a child like Bruce today? 
	Persuadee: I will. Be the change you want to see in the world, right?
Persuader: Yes you will . So how much of your earnings will you give, for a child that needs to be saved today?.
	Persuadee: 5 dollars buys a latte, and I think it should be easy for me to give up a coffee a month. I bet they have ways to set up recurring donations pretty easily.

Persuader: Save the Children
	Persuadee: How do they help children?  Food? Clothing? Shelter? Education?
Persuader: They help in the children's basic need like food and clothing. They help in whatever it takes for children to transforming their lives and the future
	Persuadee: Is this charity local?  global?  Just in my country (United States)?
Persuader: This charity is from Fairfield Town in Connecticut
	Persuadee: I think  it's important to support initiatives to help children get a good education, and have the things they need to go to school and learn.  How much should we donate?
Persuader: Ya.. It's very important. There are many way to donate money like one time gift, Monthly donor, and sponsorship for some children. 
	Persuadee: Sponsorship of a child might be interesting....I'd like to know what my donation is being used for, and that it's actually helping someone. 
Persuader: Child sponsorship works like a way of giving and that connects one compassionate person like you with one child in need. Sponsoring a child gives the chance to grow up healthy, educated and safe _ forever changing the course of their life and future. You can select a child according to your choice by age, gender 
	Persuadee: That is appealing. Does the charity send updates on how the child is doing if I sponsor?
Persuader: Ya... Definitely they will update you every information about the child you are donating
	Persuadee: How does the sponsorship work?  Do I make a monthly donation? I can't afford much. What is the minimum dollar amount?
Persuader: You can Sponsor a child for just $36 a month
	Persuadee: Let's say for this experiment, we will contribute the $36 a month for six months, and see how it goes. We can renew for another six months it it looks like the donation is working. What do you think?

Persuader: Save the children helps young ones affected by disasters of all kinds
	Persuadee: I see. Are these children specifically from poor countries? Or may it included children affected by, let's say, Hurricane Katrina back in 2005?
Persuader: There is a US Program as well as a global outlet
	Persuadee: That is good to hear. How specifically will these children be helped? Will the foundation only provide homes? Or is there more to it?
Persuader: There's definitely more to it STC provides advocacy, education, protection, and food among other services
	Persuadee: So it seems that the STC is an all around foundation, aiming to prevent disasters from stunting the progress of young ones. Do you think the foundation is part of the first helpers to a disaster? Or is it a more gradual affect they provide? 
Persuader: The foundation is with children every step of the way from the initial stages of an event to the residual effects months/years later STC looks to help
	Persuadee: I do believe being there for every step of the way can really improve the child's chances for success, which is heartwarming. Since I have not heard of the foundation from the start, do you think there impact is less great, than other foundations that are known, such as Red Cross?
Persuader: Every organization has it's own impact. STC reached 155 million children during 2017 235,000 of which were in the United States. That's a pretty big impact. You can view more stats here  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report
	Persuadee: That is a huge impact. I have quickly researched the foundation, and have seen some of these stats. It seems even corporations are involved with the foundation, such as the CEO of Chobani, who believes we should save every child possible. I believe that more companies, like chobani, should partner and donate some of the proceedings they receive to help the children. Do you agree? 
Persuader: Yes I do. Support from corporations would really help in communities across the world
	Persuadee: Refering back to the aid STC provides, do you think it is better to provide emergency assistance, just days or weeks after the disaster, or provide gradual assistance after the initial affects of the disaster has been solved? Do you think the foundation needs to pick and choose based on the funding they have?
Persuader: STC does strive to meet needs at both times, however emphasis is placed on emergency services because it is believed that is when children are most vulnerable. With proper funding we will be able to continue assisting through out the entire process. You can help How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).
	Persuadee: That makes a lot of sense, a good basis can propagate to the next few months. I have always been reluctant in donating to such foundations, due to many corruptions in this industry. It is said that most of these foundations are Non-Profit, however, some of these foundations provide false help. I have read that Red Cross showed up at a disaster with empty trucks, just for publicity. How can I know for sure any of these foundations are legit?
Persuader: I definitely understand Our independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. We keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.   In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services.   
	Persuadee: Reports on the financials of the company/foundation is very important, and I appreciate the search for the statistics. I do believe statistics like these can help and persuade people to donate more. I do believe that the government should make such reports mandatory, and even possibly provide a certain status to those foundations that do use a majority of their revenue for the purposes they claim. Do you think the government should involve themselves in such scandals that may occur?
Persuader: Government involvement may be necessary in those cases. Thankfully STC doesn't have anything to worry about in that department. Would you be willing to donate today?
	Persuadee: I appreciate the conversation and all the statistics you have given me, however, I will not be donating to said foundation. I believe a good majority of these foundations make false claims. I would be willing to volunteer, but I will not give hard earned money to something that would go against my beliefs against corporate corruption.",False,0.0

	Persuadee: What percent of donations go to staff, administrative costs, etc.?
Persuader: 9 of every 10 dollars goes directly to children in need! So only 10% to administrative costs. The other thing is that we can help a child by donating the cost of a candy bar! 
	Persuadee: How is the money distributed? Who precisely is performing the relief help?
Persuader: Volunteers provide the relief work through a variety of programs and emergency aid. The money is distributed where it is needed most - so if there is an emergency more money will go there. But there is a question that I would like to ask you.

	Persuadee: I am not going to waste the reward.  I use it for things that my family needs.
Persuader: Think about how much more those poor kids in developing countries needs the money. Your family is rich enough to live in a first world country and have food on a daily basis. By not donating this tiny amount you're directly allowing children to sufer.
	Persuadee: We work for everything that we have.  Nothing is just given to us soooo I am not going to give away something that I work for unless I want to do so.
Persuader: Of course you work for everything you own. By helping Save the Children you will directly be allowing a child to grow up and work for things him or herself rather than living in poverty and possibly not even making it out of childhood.

Persuader: No minimums whatsoever! I have friends that donate $5/month and it makes such a huge difference in the lives of these children. 
	Persuadee: I can imagine little bits adding up pretty quick if many people pitch in for such a great cause.
Persuader: Exactly. And actually, I hope you don't mind me asking, but might you be willing to donate some or all of the money you're receiving for this specific task ($2) to the Save the Children organization?

Persuader: In the U.S. and around the world, they give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. When crisis strikes, they are always among the first to respond and the last to leave. We do whatever it takes to save children, transforming their lives and the future we share.
	Persuadee: Wow, that is amazing. How long have you been involved?
Persuader: I've been involved with the organization for about a year now and have learned so much about their mission. They help children here at home and abroad
	Persuadee: And what do you do at the organization?
Persuader: I help promote the organization by speaking to people just like you and helping to generate donations.  Since the organization is not for profit, donations from individuals and organizations help them acheive their mission

Persuader: Sure. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Your donation, and other MTurkers' donations, are essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc. Your donation will make a tangible impact for the world

Persuader: It is. There is a lack of support for children in developing countries. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Do you think you would be interested in donating?
