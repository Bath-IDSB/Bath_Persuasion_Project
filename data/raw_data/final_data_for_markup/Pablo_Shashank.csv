	Persuadee: hi
Persuader: How are you?
	Persuadee: Good, thanks, how about you?
Persuader: I'm doing great, thanks.
	Persuadee: Let's talk about a children's charity.
Persuader: Okay, sounds good.
	Persuadee: Do you know of any children's charity?
Persuader: Yes, I know a really great children's charity called Save the Children.
	Persuadee: Sounds good. Tell me more please
Persuader: It is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: That sounds excellent. Do you have their website link?
Persuader: Yes, I do! It's  URL 
	Persuadee: Awesome. I would really like to support them and donate to them.
Persuader: That's awesome! You're a good person!
	Persuadee: How can I send in a donation?
Persuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.
	Persuadee: Oh, I didn't realize it would be deducted from my task payment. Can I get a receipt for tax purposes?
Persuader: Yes, donations to Save the Children are 100% tax deductible.
	Persuadee: That's good. I have decided on an amount for my donation. That will be $0.
Persuader: Is there a reason why you wouldn't like to donate? Maybe I can answer some more questions for you.",False,0.0

	Persuadee: I'm alright and you?
Persuader:  I thank you very much, with what you know about save the children
	Persuadee: I don't know much about that charity all all.
Persuader:  you've donated something to the kids lately
	Persuadee: I have not made a donation recently.
Persuader: The Save the Children Fund, commonly known as Save the Children, is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: That sounds like a decent organization.
Persuader:  the month that passed a full gift of 2 large clothes bags for these children, is a great pleasure when it helps
	Persuadee: Okay that sounds good but how much would a donation of that size be?
Persuader:  children are the most valuable thing we have all are the future and should grow well healthy and full of knowledge
	Persuadee: I suppose that is true.
Persuader:  tell me a bit about your life
	Persuadee: I make money as a musician so basically I don't make money.
Persuader: good, i take care of insurance and I like my job
	Persuadee: Alright that's cool so how does this charity take its donations.
Persuader: I posted every year a pack of any organization for kids
	Persuadee: Okay so are you trying to get me to donate?
Persuader:  I wish that in the future you also donate some
	Persuadee: Alright I will donate.",False,0.0

	Persuadee: Hello, I am fine, how about you?
Persuader: Very well thanks. Do you currently give any money to charity on a regular basis?
	Persuadee: Yes, I try to help time to time
Persuader: Any charity in particular?
	Persuadee: No, anything that catches my eyes, or I find them on gofundme, what about you?
Persuader: I have a few payments set up monthly. I assume then you've heard of Save the Children and the great work they do with young people?
	Persuadee: Yes, I've heard of it. Can you please explain more about it?
Persuader: Firstly, they provide funds and support services to help protect vulnerable children all over the world. Once the children have a safe environment the next priority is to improve their lives via education and other resources. They really make a difference to the lives of children in poverty or destitution.
	Persuadee: I am interested in it. I already checked their website. Health and education both are important factors
Persuader: Absolutely. And the great thing for us is that even a very small donation goes a long way due to the number of people who can donate! We're asking people today to give a small part of the payment for this HIT to the charity. You'll get a box pop up at teh end of our chat which will give you the opportunity to donate something. Obviously the more the better, but I also appreciate that you aren't turking for free so you can judge it yourself.
	Persuadee: Actually I like these kind of HITs. I did few HITs before that asked me to donate my bonus or half of the reward. I happily did. I am sure there are people who need it more than me
Persuader: You're absolutely right-  sometimes we don't realise it, but what seems like a little bit of moeny to us can make a big difference to them. I worked in Africa earlier this year and the difference a few dollars can make to people over there is unbelievable.
	Persuadee: Yes, few dollars can save a child or can help a family to survive for a month. How long have you worked there?
Persuader: I'm back in the UK now - I was in South Africa (Durban) for three months from January to end of March for work.
	Persuadee: That is so nice of you. It is a big thing to do. Thinking about starving children makes me so sad. I wish I could do more
Persuader: We can all do something - donate a little bit or volunteer to try to help. There are lots of opportunities
	Persuadee: Yes you are right, I help as much as I can. at least I try. ""save the children"" sounds like an amazing organization. They work in 120 countries already
Persuader: They certainly do and tehy are well established so you cna be certain they are going to use the money in a good way.
	Persuadee: Yes It looks like a trustworthy organization with no doubt. I already read few of their reports on their website. I wish they can help even more countries
Persuader: Me too. When we click done that donation box will appear - it should be pretty self-explanatory. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks again.
	Persuadee: Thank you, I will do it for sure, have a nice day",False,0.5
512,"Persuader: HI! HAVE YOU HEARD OF SAVE THE CHILDREN BEFORE?
	Persuadee: No I haven't. What is it?
Persuader: IT'S AN AMAZING GLOBAL CHARITY THAT HELPS CHILDREN IN DANGEROUS AREAS!
	Persuadee: That sounds really cool. Do they have a main country they focus on, like Haiti or somewhere in Africa?
Persuader: NO, AS A MATTER OF FACT THE CHARITY HAS TIES ACROSS THE WORLD, ALTHOUGH IT IS CURRENTLY HEAVILY INVESTED IN THE SYRIA REGION!
	Persuadee: What kind of things do they provide for the children? Do they provide shelter and basic needs?
Persuader: THE MAIN FOCUS IS USUALLY HEALTH SUCH AS MOBILE HOSPITALS OR EDUCATION, WITH DEPLOYED TEACHERS
	Persuadee: Do these teachers go all over the world, or are they specific to that country?
Persuader: ALL THE INSTRUCTORS IN THE SAVE THE CHILDREN ARE SENT IN GROUPS ON ROTATING DEPLOYMENTS OF 6 MONTHS, USUALLY TO A FEW TARGET COUNTRIES.
	Persuadee: Are the instructors volunteers? What is the process of becoming one of the instructors?
Persuader: ALL INSTRUCTORS MUST SPEAK TWO LANGUAGES AND HAVE TWO YEARS OF FORMAL TEACHING.  THEY CAN THEN APPLY TO A SPECIFIC MISSION AS THEY COME UP, USUALLY 6 MONTHS AHEAD OF THE START DATE.
	Persuadee: I imagine it's pretty hard to go overseas for so long in a different country. What kind of experience have the prior instructors had? 
Persuader: MANY HAVE LOVED IT ALTHOUGH IT CAN BE CHALLENGING, THE INSTRUCTORS ARE PAID VERY LITTLE BUT GIVEN FREE ROOM/BOARD.  HOWEVER AFTER ONE YEAR OF WORK THEY CAN APPLY THRU A SPECIAL PROGRAM TO BE CITIZENS OF THE HOST COUNTRY.
	Persuadee: That's a really cool deal. Do they get dual citizenship or is it more of an ex-pat type situation?
Persuader: THEY CAN BECOME A DUAL CITIZEN AFTER 1 YEAR IN THE PROGRAM. IN SOME CASES OUR INSTRUCTORS HAVE FOUND FULL TIME JOBS WITHIN THE HOST COUNTRY AFTER THEIR TENURE.
	Persuadee: What are some of the improvements in quality of life for the children?
Persuader: MANY OF OUR CHILDREN PUT ON GLASSES FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER VISITED AN EYE DOCTOR.  JUST A 2 DOLLAR DONATION CAN GET ONE OF OUR SPONSOR CHILDREN ACCESS TO A COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL SCREENING.
	Persuadee: Do they often get a chance to get a more thorough education than prior to becoming a part of the program?
Persuader: IT DEPENDS ON THE HOST COUNTRY AND ITS RULES, FOR EXAMPLE FEW GIRLS IN SYRIA HAD EVEN BASIC READING SKILLS DUE TO DISCRIMINATORY SCHOOL POLICIES.  WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN DONATING TO OUR EDUCATION FUND?
	Persuadee: I can't do much but I'd be willing to donate $0.20

	Persuadee: You've got it...giving you $1 and thanks for your good work!
Persuader: Thank you so much. I can assure you that your donation will be going to a trustable fund. You are amazing. I just want to help these children any way I can. It makes me cry that not everyone is treated fairly... They are our future!
	Persuadee: Goodbye for now... I'll look up your charity on the web.
Persuader: There is  lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Thank you for looking into this.

Persuader: Save the children is a charity for homeless children and food for these children.
	Persuadee: That seems like a good cause.
Persuader: Have you ever heard of Save the Children from friends or family.
	Persuadee: The name sounds familiar, but I'm not sure where I heard of it.
Persuader: You can donate any amount you like as much as $2.00.
	Persuadee: Is it international? Does it help children all around the world?
Persuader: Yes, you can donate to any child around the world, one child or a group of children.
	Persuadee: Do you know what percentage of donations goes to overhead and what percentage directly goes to the child/children?
Persuader: As far as i understand the entire amount goes to that cause.
	Persuadee: But there has to be some overhead. Is it paid for by grants rather than donations?
Persuader: no your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment any amount from $0.00 to $2.00.

Persuader: I have been donating a little more than two years.

Persuader: I'm doing well, thank you! Have you ever heard of the charity Save the Children?
	Persuadee: I have not. What do they do?
Persuader: Save the Children is a great charity that provides education, healthcare, and advocacy to children in need in the U.S. and all over the world. Does this sound like a good charity to you?
	Persuadee: It does. Children are one of the worlds most important assets. 
Persuader: I think so too! Do you believe that children in need deserve help from others?
	Persuadee: Yes. Children are more deserving in my opinion, because they are unable to care for themselves. They have no choice but to rely on others. 
Persuader: That's great that you care so much about children's needs! Save the Children is an exceptional charity in that over 86% of the donations go directly to children's programs all over the world. Have you donated to a charity before?
	Persuadee: Yes, I usually donate to soldiers or veteran related charities such as Wounded Warrior Project.
Persuader: Those are great causes also. You mentioned earlier that you believe children to be one of the world's most important assets. Would you be willing to donate your earnings from this task to Save the Children?
	Persuadee: I would if I had a specific break down or list of what programs the donations support. 
Persuader: Save the Children make the programs they support and the percentage of funding for each one available on their website. They are very transparent! Some of the causes they support include Emergencies (38%), Health and Nutrition (36%), and Education to more than 136 thousand children all over the world. The researchers curating this task collect the earnings from those who donate and send them directly to Save the Children. How much of your earnings would you be willing to donate?
	Persuadee: I don't make a lot. I would have donate a smaller amount. Like a one time donation of 100$ or so. 
Persuader: That's great! And any amount will go directly to benefiting children. However in this case I'm only asking about your earnings from this particular task :) . The full amount would be 30 cents.

Persuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity?
	Persuadee: Were you thinking one dollar each or 50 cents each to make a total of $1?
Persuader: Are you comfortable with $1? I almost feel like we have a moral obligation to donate $2 each but it's up to you
	Persuadee: To be honest I am not comfortable with donating. I would rather donate a lower amount than $1 if we decide on donating anything at all
Persuader: why are you not comfortable? Is it that you  cannot afford to? Or you don't know the charity Save the Children?
	Persuadee: I can not afford. I believe we should help ourselves before reaching out to others in need. Additionally, I don't know what exactly Save the Children is using this money for
Persuader: It is just a dollar, geeze.  As I mentioned they are using it to help children who are starving, injured or who have lost their parents. You can look up the charity to see they are legitimate.
	Persuadee: In my opinion, every dollar counts. Unless I get to see with my own eyes what the charity is doing, then I don't know if they are legitimate or not
Persuader: You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. I would donate $2 because I know there are a lot of kids out there who need the help and to me, $2 is nothing

I was hoping I could possibly persuade you into making a donation? This is for a great cause, after all I feel as though we need to do what we can in order to help other's around the world, especially ones that are in desperate need of our help - don't you agree?

You can choose any amount, from 0$ to all of your payment with the total of 2$. Any amount would be helpful, though an amount of 2$ may be small to us - we could buy candy, or something we can easily get whenever we want but to the kids, this could be a lifesaver, so every penny counts!

Persuader: No, it is a non-govermental organization that helps promote children's rights, providing relief and helps support children in developing countries. Which I think is amazing, how selfless are the people who came up with this? I just know that donating a small bit of money can really help them get one step closer to their goals. So, have you decided on the amount you'd like to donate?
	Persuadee: Almost, do you happen to know if their work is world-wide or only focused on developing countries?
Persuader: As I stated before, it is set up to support children within developing countries. Hopefully one day it will be world- wide. With your help in donating however, that could be one step closer to world-wide help!

Persuader: Have you heard of Save the Children - They do really amazing work with kids locally and globally. I like that they don't just focus on one thing, they prioritize all aspects of improving a child's life
	Persuadee: I have not heard of them before.  Would you say they want to focus on the children and improving their lives as a whole?
Persuader: Yeah definitely. They work with hunger - helping to reduce the amount of children who die from malnutrition as well as helping to support kids in war zones from violence. They do a lot of disaster relief - After the flooding in Texas last year they did a ton of work to help kids there. They also support head start organizations, and provide backpacks and back to school supplies in under served communities

Persuader: I think they have a lot of support from donors big and small. They are one of the charities that I like to support when able. Do you feel like people who have the ability are usually pretty likely to donate to a charity like this?
	Persuadee: I do feel like that they are as it is an admirable non profit.  If you could dontate today with the payment how much woud you donate?
Persuader: I would donate the whole payment. I think sometimes we forget how much impact a microdonation can have. It seems like a small amount to us, but even that 0.30 can have an impact on someones life. What about you?
	Persuadee: I think that a microdonation is appropriate and would agree with you that a .30 cent donation would be appropriate.  No matter how little it is, it eventually adds up and can still impact someones life.  So can it be concluded that we could agree to donate .30?
Persuader: Yes, I think so. .30 can add up quickly and stretch a lot further through an organization like this than one might think
	Persuadee: Agreed, despite how small it may be, I think they would greatly appreciate it.  I would feel comfortable making a microdonation to help them out no matter how small.  Are there any other non profits you normally are involved with?
Persuader: I also really like March of Dimes and St Jude - I guess I have a soft spot for charities that help children as their primary goal
	Persuadee: I have not had too many encounters with them, are you familiar with Mission 22, a npo for veterans?
Persuader: I have not heard of that one. What does it do?
	Persuadee: Its a non profit designed for veterans and mental health.  They work to provide mental health services for veterans suffering from PTSD and other mental health problems stemming from their time in the military.
Persuader: That is really awesome! I will have to look into that one further. I don't think there is enough support in that area. Thank you for sharing that one!
	Persuadee: It has been a great organization and its headed by many people as it has become a huge problem.  Despite that however, I think that for today we should commit .30 for the Save the Children for today. 
Persuader: I agree .30 is the right choice

	Persuadee: I used to cook for the local church sometimes.I prepare meals for those in needs.

Persuader: Excellent.  In that case then you are aware of the suffering many children are enduring due to food shortages, natural disasters, and war zones.  There are kids sleeping in the streets even here in the U.S.  These kids need our help. Fortunately, there is something we can do about it.
	Persuadee: yeah the Government have to do something to help the children having their safe place to live
Persuader: I completely agree.  Sadly, most government agencies that are supposed to provide this support are often staffed by corrupt or greedy management.  This leaves the task to our non-profits to help as many children as possible.  Would you like to know more about Save the Children?  Any questions I can answer?
	Persuadee: oh yeah im agree with that. but as an individual we can still help them thru giving them food something like that and or try calling the social welfare office to help the street children by having a safe shelter on there place
Persuader: Indeed we can!  And every action counts when it comes to these kids' quality of life.  While we can work individually toward our goal, it is often helpful to work with others toward a common goal.  That is where non-profits like Save the Children comes into play.  Would you mind if I were to give you a couple short facts about our organization?
	Persuadee: nope but thanks anyway
Persuader: Well I am disappointed a bit by your decision.  You know, Save the Children uses over 85% of its funding directly providing for suffering kids.  Would you help with even a small donation of $1?  Surely that isn't too much to ask?

	Persuadee: I can think of a lot more worthwhile charities.
Persuader: That may be true, but Save the Children has been recognized as reliable by charity rater. Additionally, this one has a high percentage of money raised going directly to helping support the cause. hundreds of thousands of children are dying every week due to lack of food
	Persuadee: There are three kinds of charities I never donate to:   children, diseases and veterans
Persuader: Maybe this could be an exception for you then? I can understand your reasoning, but famine is a huge problem especially right now. More crop harvests are failing reducing the already low amount of food to near-nothing
	Persuadee: Maybe thats nature limiting overpopulation.
Persuader: True, although higher populations in famine-ridden countries are necessary. There needs to be more people that are able to farm. Additionally, it's good karma. Every cent helps
	Persuadee: my cents go to worthwhile charities not the ones in those three categories.
Persuader: That's understandable. What would you consider a worthwhile charity?
	Persuadee: Homeless shelters, food pantries, environmental stuff....
Persuader: Food pantries? A lot of food worldwide comes from countries such as Zimbabwe or Haiti (countries that work with Save the Children). Right now there's famine, but by donating it will ultimately increase the worldwide food, and reduce the need for food pantries as a whole. Even though it's marketed at children, it's moreso helping the areas that have a high child poverty rate
	Persuadee: There are too many children.  
Persuader: Makes sense, but countries like Italy or Japan are experiencing a population shift. Even in countries like USA and France, more doctors and scientists are retiring than graduating. So we need kids to supplement all of those areas
	Persuadee: There are probably less doctors because the education is expensive not because there aren't enought children
Persuader: In France tuition is not as expensive as in USA. There is a lack of population from 18-24, and there's even less of a population below 15. In Japan, the birthrate is low so keeping children is key as the population retires more. Children are the future work force, and help countries run economically and socially. By supporting this charity you would directly be supporting your future
	Persuadee: It sounds like nature is taking care of overpopulation.  I applaud that.
Persuader: A lot of the time it isn't necesarrily overpopulation. In the case of Syria, there's a widespread civil war. Within the first quarter of 2018, over 1000 children were murdered by both sides. Save the Children has a mission to get as many children out of there as possible, because their heads are being used as trophies. It's sick and financial donation is the best way to help besides going there yourself

Persuader: I cannot even begin to imagine that and clean water should be a basic right to every child on this planet. 
	Persuadee: I agree. There is so much wasted in the world. I know it is possible for everyone to have enough food and water. If only the governments and politicians of the world would stop fighting and actually work toward that goal.
Persuader: Yes I agree. That is why I donate what I can to organizations like Save the Children. As you may know, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Are there any organizations that you can reccomend?
	Persuadee: I sponsor through World Vision. I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going. You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community. And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general. It is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone's life, and maybe in many lives.
Persuader: I cannot thank you enough for that. How much do you donate on average annually?
	Persuadee: Well it's $39 a month, so $468 annually. I also send him little care packages every so often. At Christmas I plan to send either $100 or $200 as a special gift to his family, which will enable them to buy a goat, some chickens, etc. That will have such a big impact on their lives.

Persuader: Their assistance is directed toward children in developing countries, where, unlike most of the US, children are totally deprived of opportunity and basic services. Though you, being the generous person you are, like helping those at home, is there a reason not to help children abroad?
	Persuadee: I don't mind helping those abroad. But there are a lot kids here in the US who deal with poverty.  So it's not that I don't care about the children elsewhere, just want to help those at home first.

Persuader: Yes I love that too.  It ensures childrens right to health, education and so on.  Do you ever volunteer or make donations?
	Persuadee: I'll be honest with you, I have made donations to children's charities in the past. Like when I was in my twenties, but these days I have only made donations to animal rescue groups within the past two years. It's a very long story that begins with me witnessing a severe animal abuse (cats) case in my town.  
Persuader: You are an amazing person for caring for these  babies.  Animals are like children.  In the first 2 months of 2018 alone 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured.  Save the Children is an amazing organization.
	Persuadee: How were these children killed or injured -- because I know that many people (children too) are slaughtered on the highway in horrific road accidents.  If Save the Children helps those children who are orphaned or injured like this, then it is an amzing organization.Is that what this applies to?
Persuader: The children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. syrian children have grown up facing daily threat of violence.
	Persuadee: I watched a video on YouTube a couple of years ago. It was Syrian children in a classroom, they were coloring pictures. It completely broke my heart because of their precious sweet innocence and intelligence.  Their lives were in danger constantly from the threat of terrorism.
Persuader: It is so sad that children have to been in the middle of all the hate in the world today.  It breaks my heart to see and hear of how bad children have to live and what they go thru each and every single day. 
	Persuadee: Me too. I think about the little face I saw and since it was so long ago, I wonder if each and every one is okay -- still alive. 
Persuader: Making a small donation today will indeed help children and their families in such sad situations.  Would you be willing to donate from your task payment today?
	Persuadee: Absolutely. I hope everyone does.

	Persuadee: Yes it is hard to tell whose interests really lie in the movement they promote. I like to research organizations first to see if the money I give is really going to the cause, or if it is wasted by high overhead costs. 
Persuader: Yeah I totally understand that. I know the commercials are heart wrenching...seeing all those children suffer and hurting. It breaks my heart.

We do whatever it takes for children ¡ª transforming their lives and the future we share ¡ª because we believe every child deserves a future.
	Persuadee: Where in the world are the children located?
Persuader: US and global, wherever children need help, they are there.
	Persuadee: If I donate $25, does that go a long way?
Persuader: Absolutely, a small amount of money for us turns out to be life changing for those in need. A dollar can buy a lot!
	Persuadee: Will it help towards education?
Persuader: Yes, it is one of the core programs. It leads children out of poverty so is a large focus.
	Persuadee: Do you accept monthly donations of smaller amounts?
Persuader: You can do a one time donation or a monthly subscription.
	Persuadee: What are the amounts for monthly subscriptions?
Persuader: between 5 - 100
	Persuadee: Do I get updates on a specific child if I donate monthly?
Persuader: Yes you can sponsor a child and receive specific information about what your money is doing and how they are progressing each month.
	Persuadee: To what age are children receiving help?
Persuader: From infants to young adults all children are helped.
	Persuadee: I would like to donate $5 monthly.
Persuader: Thank you, that is wonderful and you will help a tremendous amount!

551,"Persuader: What is your opinion of donating to charity? 
	Persuadee: I think it's really important!  I think if we have more than others it's a natural response!
Persuader: I agree! I think it's really important, though, to know that the charity you're giving to is going to use the funds well and isn't corrupt. 
	Persuadee: Agreed.  We try to actually know people involved before we give regularly.
Persuader: That\'s awesome and such an important step. Have you ever heard of ""Save the Children""? I worked with them in Greece; they operate in refugee camps and other high-risk zones to address specifically the needs of kids
	Persuadee: I have heard of them.  They sounds like a great charity from what I know.  We do something similar by sponsoring a child from an Ethiopian orphanage we visited.  What was your experience being in Greece like?  I don't think of it as being high risk...
Persuader: Actually, many Greek refugee camps are rated as as-bad or worse than many camps in war zones. It's complete chaos, overrun by gangs and gang violence, and often lacking in basic hygiene and access to clean water or food. Women are frequently raped while trying to use the toilets (which are horrendous) and rats run amok among the tents. One of the children we were working with had a huge rat bite on her foot and many of them had fled to Greece on their own. 
	Persuadee: Wow!  Did you feel safe?  What could you do to help?  
Persuader: It was nuts - we even had a neo-Nazi mob hunting us in the streets one night. I definitely did not feel safe there. We tried to do our best to get kids registered and provide English classes and some amount of regularity for them. Save the Children created a space just for kids and mothers and were able to assist with getting them into school
	Persuadee: What an amazing experience!  That kind of thing shapes your life!  
Persuader: Well, yeah, but it's much more important to address the things shaping the lives of these children. That's why I think it's so important to donate to Save the Children. Even if we can't always be there, they are making the effort everyday
	Persuadee: Do you still keep in touch with people over there?  Do you donate directly?
Persuader: I do donate directly, not just to Save the Children, but to several other organizations as well. I still have friends working over there. This HIT we're doing has offered to donate some of our income to the charity. I always take MTurk requesters up on it when they ask us to donate our earnings. I mean, other people can use the $2 more than me, right? 
	Persuadee: For sure!  Our money can do a long way!  I can donate my 30 cents!
Persuader: Hey, that's awesome! Actually you're allowed to donate anywhere from $0-$2, not just your 30 cents! It's completely up to you. Once we decide to donate then they'll send the payment to Save the Children
	Persuadee: I'll do 30 cents.  We actually give over 25% of our income away, but that's because we research and really KNOW the organizations.  I don't have a personal connection to Save the Children, like I do with the child in Ethiopia.
Persuader: Absolutely! There are so many organizations around the world these days it's hard to know which one is the best. Do you know the website charitynavigator.org? It provides info on tons of organizations around the world 
	Persuadee: No - actually we don't LOOK for places to give - they just happen with people we get involved with/ and through our church.  I'm sure it's a great website.  Is that how you got plugged in with Save the Children?
Persuader: Oh, no, that's just one I use if someone is recommended a charity to me. I got involved with Save the Children because I was working with a local NGO in Greece and we partnered with them frequently for English classes and kid's activities and safety

	Persuadee: What kind of aid do they give?
Persuader: They help provide water, give children access to education, give girls tampons so that they can attend school on their period, give them vaccines - things like that. 
	Persuadee: A couple of organizations claim to do that. Why should I donate to this one in particular?
Persuader: You're right. A lot of organization collect funds and then it goes to administration or advertising and not a lot of money goes to the people who need it the most. Save the Children makes sure to give as much as they possibly can, because they understand that when it comes to people who are starving, every penny counts.
	Persuadee: Is there any concrete proof that they do? Words are just words sometimes.
Persuader: I totally understand that! They have a full list of the percentages that they spend on each thing at  URL so you can see exactly where your money is going!

You can choose any amount between 0 and all of your payment for this task.

	Persuadee: I'm glad a charity like that exists internationally.
Persuader: It's for a great cause. Children are the future and unfortunately too many of them don't get the quality of life that we take advantage of today. Sometimes we're in a better place and we have to do what we can to help their conditions a little bit. Even little bits can go a long way, you know?
	Persuadee: it does, and charities can go further with the amount of money donated.
Persuader: Absolutely. I remember seeing ads on the television about it and it breaks my hear to see children so sad and suffering in conditions that they live in. I haven't personally witnessed experiences first hand, however, it comes down to basic human needs.
	Persuadee: It's sad to think being born in the wrong conditions can have such a lifelong impact.
Persuader: Exactly. It's not like we really get the choice of how/when/where we are born. It's a matter of chance. It's unfair to be born into conditions like that.
	Persuadee: Hopefully, more the people born more lucky can lend a hand.
