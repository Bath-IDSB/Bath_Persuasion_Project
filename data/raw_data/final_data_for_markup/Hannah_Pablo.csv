	Persuadee: Hi, Im doing pretty good!
Persuader: Have you ever thought of donating?
	Persuadee: Yeah plenty of times
Persuader: Have you ever heard of the Save the Children charity?
	Persuadee: Yeah its a fantastic organization that works with children
Persuader: Would you be willing to donate some of you earning from today's task to them?
	Persuadee: Yeah, i would b willing to donate $1 dollar to Save the Children charity.
Persuader: Wow, that is awesome. Thank you so much. At the end of the task it will ask you how much you would like to donate?
	Persuadee: Ok! I will donate a dollar to the organization at the end of the task
Persuader: Thank you very much. They are an amazing charity helping children all over the world including the ones right here in America
	Persuadee: Yeah I agree. It's definitely for a good cause 
Persuader: They are all ready setting up to help the children in Hawaii if the hurricane does hit them.
	Persuadee: Wow thats incredible! They are always prepared to help even before an event such as a hurricane happens.
Persuader: Did you know they have been around 100 years?
	Persuadee: No, did you know who founded the organization?
Persuader: No, I am not sure. I do love that they are there for Advocacy, Education, Emergency, and Protection.
	Persuadee: Yeah they focus on a variety of different areas to help out children
Persuader: They are on the ground in 120 countries it is so amazing
	Persuadee: Props to them for being in over 120 different countries. That is one heck of an achievement. ",False,1.0
284,"Persuader: Could you please donate all of your$2 to Save the Children?  Hunger kills millions of children worldwide ever year.
	Persuadee: No thank you, I understand that hunger kills millions of children world wide every year, however the CEO's of that company are multi billionaire entrepreneurs. 
Persuader: Save the Children has been around since 1919 qng is top rated by Charity Watch.
	Persuadee: How much of the Save the Children money, go to children in the United States?
Persuader: In fiscal year 2016, on average, 86.5% of all expenditures support program services. 86.5% is an average for all of Save the Children's programs worldwide.
	Persuadee: I don't agree with the fact that they give so much to Britians poor families, when poor families in America could use money through this charity
Persuader: What makes American children more needy?  To be honest, not having a cell phone is hardly poverty. American children are hardly in the situation that many African children are
	Persuadee: I feel that if America is going to be at the forefront of a charity...it should be helping our own...for instance, our veterans are highly under benefited and paid!!!!  Why not give to them!!!  Maybe Africa's government should do something about their needy children since this charity expects the U.S. to do something about theirs!!
Persuader: Why not be charitable to all?  $2 is hardly a sum to argue about.  17 cents can feed  child overseas.  12 kids could be fed today with that money.  Hope didn't go to Starbucks today and get a $4 coffee.  Now that's a corporate contribution.
	Persuadee: No I don't spend my money at Starbucks because they don't support gun rights...  For being an ambassador for this charity you are sure quick into bullying someone to give to this charity!!!
Persuader: I'm not being a bully. Ok, if $2 is too much, how about $1?  I'm with you on gun rights BTW.
	Persuadee: I tell you what I will feed one over sees child at .12, I take these task roles, to make money not give it away...if I wasn't living paycheck to paycheck I would not be doing them.
Persuader: I'm in the same boat.  I need the money too.  But it wouldn't hurt to give a little.  MTurk doesn't exactly pay subsistence wages.  
	Persuadee: Your right, but every little bit helps!  When you have two children and have a husband that works his butt off, and you are a college student...you have to do something to fill in the gaps
Persuader: I'm a retiree. Let's say Social Security isn't a treasure trove either.
	Persuadee: I know the boat your in too, I have grandparents that can barely make ends meet.  With what they bring in, in social security payments. 
Persuader: Despite all, I will donating a dollar.  I hope you do too.
	Persuadee: I will donate .12 and I wish my grandparents would learn how to be technical on a computer, so they could earn some money to supplement their income...like you.

	Persuadee: I am good, thank you! And you?
Persuader: I am doing really good. How is the weather by you today?
	Persuadee: Rainy and a bit cold.  How do you feel about Children's Charities? 
Persuader: Yes it is rainy and cold-ish here too. I feel pretty good about charities.
	Persuadee: I was hoping you would be willing to donate to the Children's Charity - it helps sick kids with their medical costs, helps the parents stay close to them at no cost.  Do you think you could donate $1000?
Persuader: Wow! That is a lot. I have heard about all of the storms in Hawaii, and I know kids there need help. I am not sure I can give that much. How much are you willing to give?
	Persuadee: I plan to give about $100 and heard that a corporation would donate the same amount, so that would be great, wouldn't it? 
Persuader: Oh, that really would be great. I would be willing to donate. Can you take less than $1000?
	Persuadee: Sure, whatever you can afford would be absolutely amazing!!  All donations will be matched so it all adds up quickly. Would you be able to donate $500?
Persuader: I think I could donate $500. Can you make your donation a little more, or not?
	Persuadee: You know what, it is really important to help the hurricane victims so I will be happy to dig a bit deeper and donate $500.
Persuader: Oh thank you! I feel so bad about all of the children. They really are suffering. I know how hungry, and in need of medical attention they must be. I know I would be devastated if my own kids needed help. Or any of my family's kids. Do you have any kids in your family?
	Persuadee: I do have an adult child,and a grandson- so any childs need really tugs at me. And it looks like the Childrens Charity and the Hurricane Relief will help many kids, and their parents.  I am going to also add a go fund me on the internet  for the Children's Charity to try to raise more money. Is that something that you might do for Hawaii?
Persuader: Yes, Save the Children has a great website. I am going to look into what else they do. Have you looked at their site?
	Persuadee: I plan to to do that! So we have agreed that we will give $500 each to our charities. I know that will be a huge help. I thank you so much for donating to such a great cause!
Persuader: Yes. When you look at their site, you will see it is based in Ct, but they are doing great things all over. I feel really good about giving. How do you feel?
	Persuadee: I love helping anyone - especially in the US.  I am going to look into volunteering opportunities as well.  I would love to be a part of either charity. Do you actually volunteer with Save the Children?
Persuader: I have not yet. Have you?
	Persuadee: No, but our donations will be a good start! Volunteering is something I want to do very soon.  Again, thank you so much for your most generous donation and time!",False,0.0
286,"Persuader: Hello.  I have a story to share with you.
	Persuadee: Of course im hear to listen .
Persuader: I just donated to Save the Children and feel like it will be super helpful.  There was a child who died of hunger and I think my donation will help other children.  
	Persuadee: Yes i believe it most DEFINETLY will make a big impact on others lives and its amazing to see such kind hearted people like yourself do so.
Persuader: Thanks! I just read that The United Nations estimated last year 25,000 people still die of hunger daily. That means more than 9.1 million people die of hunger every year.
	Persuadee: Yes its such a sad thing to see happen myself and family are very kind hearted and feel for all the people around the world who are suffering from this , And would love to make a change and to help .
Persuader: Great to hear there are still kind hearted people to help people suffering! It makes me angry to know of so many children in danger in the world.
	Persuadee: Yes its so sad how people can go about their day and not think of those who are in great need ! Especially those who are very wealthy themselves and don't care to make a difference 
Persuader: I agree!  I certainly am not wealthy but still try to make donation as often as I can.  There are some wealthy people that are great philanthropists, but I think more people like you and I are needed to make even small donations.  Have you ever been to the Save the Children website?  URL 
	Persuadee: Yes most definitely i totally agree with you! Yes i do i actually watch a family on youtube that raises money every year live streaming for save the children and all the money they receive goes to save the children   
Persuader: You can make a donation from your incoming earning from this task to Save the Children.  Even just a small amount makes a difference? I just realized I sound like a telemarketer! Can you donate part of your payment? I think we should.
	Persuadee: As of right now i honestly would but i dont have the funds for it if their are other ways im albe to get others to donate as well and help out in any way possible i will be more then willing to do so..
Persuader: Even just a small donation helps. I will donate again if you match the amount of a snack!  Maybe .50 perhaps?
	Persuadee: of course i could do so from my paypal
Persuader: The research team will collect donations and send it to Save the Children. So we don't even need to use Paypal.
	Persuadee: oh okay then thats awsome to hear 
Persuader: Ok great!  I think we are really part of the solution this way. Especially if that story of a child who died makes you angry like me.  It's so easy we won't even miss it.
	Persuadee: Exacally if 50cents can make a differnce in someones like and i can help im all for it !!
Persuader: (Inserts high five) My good deed for the day is done! I try to do little things like this whenever I can. In fact, I'm going to match your .50 and donate a $1.
	Persuadee: wow how awsome it will really make a difference and i'm so happy we can both help to make a difference (double high five )
Persuader: Thanks for agreeing to donate! It was great talking to you and meeting someone who has a big heart like me :)
	Persuadee: Thank you For being able to be so kind hearted as well hope u have a great day and keep a smile on your face ;)
Persuader: It feels great
	Persuadee: Most definitely does  and hope it will make someone else feel 10 times just as great 
Persuader: I am glad the Researchers are helping too!  Make it a great day!
	Persuadee: Yes i didnt think that it would be this easy thats amazing 
Persuader: I have done it this way before and encourage you to do the same. Skipping my candy bar today and feeling great! 
	Persuadee: yes i cant wait to be able to do more in the future yes it does feel good to know that will be going to a much better cause 
Persuader: (one last high five before I go) I'd love to chat with you more, but I have to run off --- my coffee is brewing and waiting for me to indulge.  Take care and keep doing good!

287,"Persuader: Hi
	Persuadee: Hello
Persuader: I'm here to talk about the charity Save the Children. It is an amazing charity and is very efficient with their funding.
	Persuadee: I think I have heard of it, but do not know that much about it aside from a general idea that they support children
Persuader: They are an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps children in developing countries. This is a really great opportunity for you to donate your bonus without having to actually give money out of your pocket. 
	Persuadee: If I am giving money out of my bonus, then it is kind of coming out of my pocket
Persuader: That is one way to look at it. I think that if you were going to donate at any point, this would be an easy way to do it. Or at least a portion of the bonus. Don't you think donating feels good?
	Persuadee: Donating doesn't feel good or bad for myself. It is a means to support something if I think the cause is worthwhile and I trust the charity to spend the money in a way I agree with
Persuader: That is true, the money is making a real and tangible difference regardless of how it makes you feel. I think that everyone should give a little bit here and there because it really adds up and the money can increase their quality of life likely more than it could for you.
	Persuadee: Why would you think that? You really do not know about me or my situation. The fact that we are on here working on surveys may lend to the fact we need money
Persuader: That is definitely true I can't make any assumptions about you, you could have kids to feed yourself, etc. But all I'm saying is that most of Save the Children's funding goes to third world nations, really terrible places and war-stricken areas. They just want food and water to be happy.
	Persuadee: That may be so, and the charity may do good work, I really do not know. That being said, I would rather keep my own money and donate to the charity in my local area as I see fit rather than support someone across the globe 
Persuader: Fair enough, but please consider donating even a tiny fraction of the bonus. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.
	Persuadee: I will keep my bonus and donate $0
Persuader: Can't blame you for that at all.
	Persuadee: Good luck in convincing other's though. While I do not choose to donate, I looked up the charity and it does look to be a decent cause. I just believe in working local first and then worrying about international issues
Persuader: Makes perfect sense, it is sensible to want to help those you're familiar with. The survey should continue at this point I think.
	Persuadee: No idea, I have no button to make it progress. One other idea since I have to wait here anyway. If they really want us to give a portion of our bonus then they should probably offer a bit more of one. As it is we make less than 6 an hour if we keep the full bonus
Persuader: Yeah that was what I was thinking, the base amount is very low. I think it's waiting for 10 messages each so it should continue now. Have a good day!
	Persuadee: Thanks, you do the same",False,0.0
289,"Persuader: Hi! How is your day going?
	Persuadee: I'm doing well. How are you?
Persuader: I'm pretty good. Thanks. I wanted to let you know about the great charity I know. It's called Save the Children.
	Persuadee: I've heard of it. They do great work.
Persuader: Yes they do. They use nearly 100% of money donated to go directly to charity with very few overhead costs of their own.
	Persuadee: Pretty impressive compared to other charities.
Persuader: Yes it is. I've heard of many stories from them about how many thousands of starving children they've helped in African countries and Middle Eastern countries as well.
	Persuadee: That is great. There are a lot of organizations that help, but they are one of the bigger names.
Persuader: Have you thought about how much extra money you have around the house that you could collect and donate to Save the Children?
	Persuadee: Well honestly, I don't have as much as you would like to me too at this point. But I do donate to a very similar charity monthly.
Persuader: Well as you know you've been given some extra money that you can donate directly to Save the Children. This won't affect you at all but will really help many of those poor starving children.
	Persuadee: I know that. I am willing to donate some of the money, I do need to keep some to pay my bills and feed my kiddos too.
Persuader: Absolutely! Of course you shouldn't donate more than you can. But any small amount that you would be able to donate is always greatly appreciated!
	Persuadee: Well I would be willing to do that.
Persuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).
	Persuadee: I think 10% would be good. So 20 cents?
Persuader: That's a great decision! Thanks very much for your support. You'll get to confirm your donation on the next screen. It was great talking to you!

Persuader: There is a child right now 8000 miles away from you who is living daily with violence and no food. But we can help her.
	Persuadee: How do we help her?
Persuader: We take money that we would spend for a piece of candy or a cup of coffee and put aside for her. Just one time will make a difference for her.
	Persuadee: That sounds like a great idea! Let's do it!
Persuader: Ok. It makes me mad that so many children around the world are facing such challenges while we sit in our comfortable home with every need met. How about you?
	Persuadee: Yes, it is very disheartening. I hope that more people see the need to help others like we see the need.
Persuader: Would you like to know the charity I am talking about?
	Persuadee: Yes. Please tell me more about the charity.
Persuader: It has been around for over fifty years. It is called Save The Children. They take our money and help with safety, health, and shelter for children who need it desperately.
	Persuadee: I like the fact that they have history. Do you think 100% of our donations will go to the children?
Persuader: They keep 1% for overhead but the rest goes right to the children to better the lives of them and their family.
	Persuadee: That sounds fair. Do we know what geographic area we will be donating to?
Persuader: Yes. It is the mountainous region of Uganda.
	Persuadee: That is amazing! How can we get more people involved?
Persuader: We make a donation then we tell how good it made us feel and who we helped like Lina, the girl I was talking about.
	Persuadee: Ok. I would definitely like to donate!
Persuader: How much would you like to donate from $0 to your payment of $2?

Persuader: Have you ever heard of Save the Children foundation?
	Persuadee: Yes, I have heard of the Save the Children Foundation.
Persuader: Would you be interested in donated part of your task payment directly to Save the Children?
	Persuadee: I actually am not ready to donate to the foundation yet.  I would like to find out more about it first before donating.
Persuader: Your donation is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, and safety. Millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. You can learn more at  URL 
	Persuadee: Thank you so much for providing additional information about the organization, but I am not ready to donate yet. 
Persuader: Just .77 a day can help shelter a refugee family. That's less than a cup of coffee, or even your mid day snack. That .77 can change a child's life forever. Would you please reconsider?
	Persuadee: I understand, but I just need more time to do my own research about the organization and think about it. I am not ready to donate right now.
Persuader: You could make just a one time donation of your task profit today. Only .10 would change a life. Would you reconsider for only .10?

	Persuadee: Hm. Isn't this the sort of group that the government should help?
Persuader: Everything helps, and honestly they could use it more than we could. Children die of hunger everyday and your donation could help prevent that.
	Persuadee: At the moment, I'm pretty strapped for cash. In fact, I could probably use a donation!
Persuader: Well, you could donate anything from $0.01 to $2.00. Would you be willing to donate even $0.01?
	Persuadee: What would be the point of donating such a small amount? It would be better to try to find others that could donate more.
Persuader: No amount is too little unless it is nothing. Save the Children is a well established charity, so they have a large reach and it all adds up. You can check them out at their website:  URL 
	Persuadee: Where does StC do its work? I've never heard of StC. Is this a real org?
Persuader: They are a global charity, they also work in the US. You can check out their website, it is indeed a reputable organization. 
	Persuadee: Have you ever made a donation to them? Or has anyone that you know made a donation? 
Persuader: I have not, but in this instance I wouldn't mind donating. It is just a bonus.

Persuader: Well, we will just sit here going back and forth and then neither of us get the bonus? I assure you that even a penny would help.
	Persuadee: Would you be willing to donate yourself?
Persuader: Yes, of course. For all we know this is theoretical money.
	Persuadee: How much would you be willing to donate?
Persuader: I usually do half because I feel it is fair and these organizations could use it more than I could. Anything below a dollar I would consider donating. Do you ever donate to things in your personal life?

Persuader: I have as well to March of Dimes and our local pet shelter. I've also volunteered at the pet shelter. Have you heard of Save the Children?
	Persuadee: I think I have read something on that agency but it has been a long time. Is that the one that you pay so much to help feed them in other countries? 
Persuader: Yes! It's an international organization that helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: Ok, yes I know that one. 
Persuader: Do you have children? I have fur babies & a couple nephews.
	Persuadee: I have 3 children, dogs and cats. I like to help children in need because I can't imagine what the parents go through and I never know when something may happen close to home and I would want some type of help to get my family through a hard situation. Do you donate to Save the Children
Persuader: I agree. Times are tough and everyone needs help every now and then. I've recently become aware of Save the Children. I've been supporting a similar organization and would like to add Save the Children to my list. What about you?
	Persuadee: Yes, it looks like it is very inexpensive so I would definitely add it to my list when I have extra money to donate. 
Persuader: I read that in the first two months of 2018 alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in the violence in Syria. Save the Children helps kids like that. 
	Persuadee: That is horrible. I would definitely donate if it helps save even one life. If it helps them get through this then I am all for it. Children shouldn't have to live like that. 
Persuader: It's horrible. What would you say to donating all or part of your income from this task?
	Persuadee: I definitely will be donating part of it for sure.
Persuader: That's great! It will make a tangible impact for sure. They are a trustable fund and make a big impact on these innocent children.
	Persuadee: Yes it will!
Persuader: There's a lack of support for children in developing countries. I tend to think about animals more since I have 2 dogs and no kids of my own but after hearing about all the violence and issues these kids have, it breaks my heart
	Persuadee: It's absolutely terrible. I wish people would do more to donate to help these kids but some organizations stole money from people which makes others very leery of donating. That ruined it for many and I'm sure they lost a lot of donations after that. I could not imagine my children living like this and hate seeing other children living like that. I wish I could do more.

Persuader: Indeed. This organization relies on our donations to keep it going. Don't you think we should help it
	Persuadee: without a doubt.  i believe in helping just about any charity; i just wish i had more money to offer.  but i do what i can and charities that involve kids are near the top of my list.
Persuader: Even a small amount can help much. No donation is small and every penny counts towards helping them
	Persuadee: that's a wonderful sentiment.  i'd be happy to make a contribution as this sounds like a fine charity that needs assistance.

Persuader: Being spiritual helps and most importantly helping the servants of God who are in desperate situation will make you even closer to Him
	Persuadee: I truly believe in God.  I know we are not expected to understand why He does everything the way He chooses but i don't have to know the reasons to know He exists.
Persuader: I have to tell helping those children will make you feel good in the long-run. That is the power of charitable actions

Persuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

	Persuadee: not so fast what does the money go to
Persuader: As I mentioned previously, for ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc. For example Save the Children was one of the first to provide assistance after the Puerto Rico hurricanes to children whose parents had died in the storms with food and shelter.

	Persuadee: I think it depends on the charity. I think there is sometimes charities that are not as transparent about where the donations go. 
Persuader: so some charities steal and some do the gods work?
	Persuadee: I don't know that I would consider it stealing. I think that some charities use funds for things other than direct support. I think it is the donaters responsibility to research ahead of their donation
Persuader: if they get couch what would be the sentence? 
	Persuadee: If they got caught stealing from a charity? or if they just don't use the funds correctly. I think it would be two different things
Persuader: the firs question, If they got caught stealing from a charity?
	Persuadee: If they got caught stealing from a charity they should go to jail. For how long depends on how much money they stole though
Persuader: and if they dont manage the funds correctly ?
	Persuadee: I don't think there should be a legal punishment for that. That would result in them losing their position
Persuader: you think that the money managing and where the money go must be transparent?

Persuader: what are your questions

Persuader: millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

Persuader: Save the Children is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to ensure each and every child's rights to health, education, safety, etc. 
	Persuadee: Do you work for Save the Children?
Persuader: No, but I am a huge advocate for the alienable rights of children and decided to spread the word about the organization in order to gain more traction for the work.
	Persuadee: What countries does Save the Children provide services in?
Persuader: Currently, Save the Children all around the globe, from the United States to Haiti, to Bangladesh, Bolivia, etc. In fact, you can sponsor an individual child from a certain country, and help provide them with the sustenance they need to simply survive.
	Persuadee: Well I think it is a noble task you are doing. 
Persuader: Thank you for very much. I was just curious if you would like to help a child in need and donate some of your task payment money  to Save the Children. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).
	Persuadee: I would like to split it - $1 for Save the Children and $1 for me. 
Persuader: That is very kind of you! These children are very grateful for people like you. People who care
	Persuadee: I am not the most charitable person but it is something... 
Persuader: And something it is! You don't know how many people would not even think twice about helping those in need. You are part of the solution for these problems. Thank you

Persuader: Thank you. I just have one more question... What was the deciding factor that convinced you to donate to Save the Children?

Persuader: I'm doing well thank you for asking. Have you donated to any charities lately?
	Persuadee: If by lately you mean the last few days, no. But, about a month ago I donated to St Jude for the purpose of entering in a raffle to win a house. The ticket was $100.
Persuader: Those are a great way to give and also be able to receive yourself.  St Jude is a great foundation.  Have you ever heard of Save the Children charity?
	Persuadee: Yes, I have. I believe it's a charity that focuses on aiding children in impoverished foreign lands.
Persuader: Yes that is correct.  Are you aware about what is going on in Syria recently?
	Persuadee: If by what is going on Syria you mean the civil war, yes. I'm not too informed on the details, but my assumption, based on what I've seen on the news is that Bashar Al-Asad wants to maintain his position of power while the rebels are trying to overthrow him.
Persuader: It is unfortunate what is happening there. There has been a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.  Save the children is focused on keeping more children out of harms way.
	Persuadee: Does Save the Children assist in keeping Syrian children out of harms way? I'm assuming there must be some sort of evacuation program or that they provide medical attention and supplies.
Persuader: Yes they are focusing on numerous ways to help out so this doesn't continue to happen.  Medical attention, supplies, shelter, food are provided.  Do you want to help these children out today with the money we would be getting from this task?

	Persuadee: Tell me more
Persuader: So this is charity organisation where you can sponsor a child in a country you choose
	Persuadee: what do they do for the children?
Persuader: All across the globe, children are dying from preventable causes, missing out on education due to poverty or gender, suffering from violence, exploitation and neglect, and are vulnerable in times of crisis. In every corner of the world, children need a strong voice to stand up for them, work on their behalf and make their lives better.
	Persuadee: what percentage of donations actually go to help the children vs. administrative expenses?
Persuader: In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program service.8% to fundraising and 5% for administrative expenses
	Persuadee: that is a pretty good ratio but i would rather see more than 90 percent go directly to help the children
Persuader: Agree,the more money goes to children the better.
	Persuadee: how do they decide which children to help?
Persuader: You can choose yourself which one to help,there is something like catalog on their website.Where you choose which children to sponsor.

Persuader: Save the children is a well established charity. It helps children around the world who are in need. For example, it helps children in Syria. In the first 2 months of this year, 1000 children were killed because of violence. So the charity helps address issues like that.
	Persuadee: Oh that sounds interesting, is there any way to know if they're a legitimate charity that really help people for real?
Persuader: Sure. You can go to  URL and read all about it. But I can tell you that they have an A rating from American Institute of Philanthropy and are one of the largest 50 charities, as ranked by Forbes.
	Persuadee: Oh cool well that's good to know, that sounds trust worthy. I think donating sounds like a good idea. 
Persuader: I agree. It's an amazing cause. Do you have children?
	Persuadee: Yes, I have three sons and I can't imagine them having to deal with the issues that some kids around the world deal with. Do you have any?

Persuader: That would be great. Any amount that you can give will really help a child out there who needs it. In this task, the research team will collect all the donations and send them directly to Save the children.

Persuader: I believe so. So you said you're looking to donate around 1.25 to Save the children?
	Persuadee: Yeah I think I will probably donate that much. I want to donate a lot but still make this HIT a decent pay.

Persuader: I was thinking of giving them the whole amount. I feel strongly that help is needed for children's rights to health, education, safety, etc. Have you ever checked out their website? 
	Persuadee: No, I haven't.  I can give 1.00.  I have puppies to feed!!  Not saying that they are more important, but they are my kids. Sound good?
Persuader: So you plan to give $1.00? That is a fantastic amount. Yes you are right your pups are your kids and they are just as important. I bet the pups give you some security in the high crime area.

	Persuadee: Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?   
Persuader: Yes, I absolutely have. Save the Children is a great organization. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.
	Persuadee: I have not heard of Save the Children before.   Sounds like they really help education wise.
Persuader: They do. But they also assist in other ways. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. 
	Persuadee: Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.  Oh so they do more than just help with education.  Thats awesome!!  
Persuader: Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. 
	Persuadee: I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.  WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.
Persuader: I couldn't agree more. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. 
	Persuadee: It sure does.  ANything else I should know about this charity?
Persuader: It is a huge movement. They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. 
	Persuadee: WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.   SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?
Persuader: Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! These kids really deserve it :)
	Persuadee: I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.
Persuader: You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Literally every penny helps these children. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. 
	Persuadee: Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.   So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?  Do i pay online or how do I go about it?
Persuader: Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. There's no paying online or entering payment info. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)
	Persuadee: Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.  YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.

	Persuadee: Is this the same group where people used to ""sponsor"" a child?
Persuader: Here is their website, URL  They help children all around the world.For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

	Persuadee: Hi there!
Persuader: Would you like to consider donating to the Save the Children charity? I can let you in on some details and questions you may have.
	Persuadee: I would prefer to find a charity that assist either in the medical funding side of children's cancer or financial burden assistance to the families of children with cancer. I feel like we can have more of a direct impact on something. Do you know of any charities like that?
Persuader: Unfortunately no. However, the charity does in fact help the children access basic necessities such as food and water to those impacted by natural disasters across the globe. So while not directly helping families financially they are relieving some burdens.
	Persuadee: Okay, I'm already familiar with Save the Children, I just typically have concerns on where the money actually goes with them. But how much are you thinking we should donate?
Persuader: Any amount will do, however it'll be extracted from the task payment. I'd say .15 cents from both of us should be fair. Also my mistake earlier, Save the Children apparently has had a childhood cancer treatment going on for a few years now.
	Persuadee: Okay, I think .15 cents sounds fair. And good, that makes me feel a bit better. 
Persuader: Thanks for the consideration. Is there anything else you'd like to know?
	Persuadee: Do you know how long the organization has been around?
Persuader: Around the year 1919 near World War I, founded by Eglantyne Jebb in London.

Persuader: 157 million children approximately, as well as 56 million children receiving direct help.

Persuader: Even the little bit you donate from your earnings can go a long way to making a difference for a child.
