Persuader: They are actually really great. They provide help to children all across the globe and stand up for children's rights.
	Persuadee: I know some charities only give a small percentage of donations to children and the rest go to their employees wages. Do they?
Persuader: I thought that too at first, but luckily save the children is a non-governmental charity, so no one is sticking their hands into the pot.
	Persuadee: Thats good, I see they are ready to help out with the hurricane in Hawaii for the kids.
Persuader: Yes! You have to think about how helpless children can be. Every penny can make a huge difference even if it doesn't feel like it.

Persuader: Alabama. If you like to help you can donate to them, it does not have to be a lot. Small amount all build up to a greater good, so you do not have to feel guilty when you donate a small amount. 
	Persuadee: Can you tell me exactly what kind of support they can provide? What is your role in this charity?
Persuader: Well I am just a volunteer who is passionate about the cause the organization provides to many children who would otherwise not have access to the resources that Save the Children provides to them.

Persuader: Well you can call them at 1.800.728.3843. But I can assure you that their donation portal is very secure with McAfee Security.
	Persuadee: That is somewhat reassuring. Can you tell me what the average donation is? 
Persuader: Usually $25 is a average donation because it is not too much yet it can be just enough to know that your donation is going to a good cause. But there is a button where you can choose however much you want to donate so there is not pressure to donate a lot. 
	Persuadee: Great. Now, the instructions regarding this chat indicate that I can donate from my payment for chatting with you. Does this mean mturk or save the children will automatically be paid if I decide to donate my payment, meaning I do not have to do anything more?

Persuader: No need to feel guilty. People don't have a choice of who or where they are born to. Those of us who got lucky, can always lend a hand in our own ways. What do you think?

Persuader: I would love to and I do, but I rarely get the opportunity to help those who can't help themselves and I feel that this is a great way to make the world a better place for everyone.
	Persuadee: You make a great point there.

Persuader: Save the children do amazing work with kind kids
	Persuadee: How long has this charity been in existence?
Persuader: They have been providing great services for kids for over 10 years
	Persuadee: How are they rated as a charity? Do you have access to their overhead and admin costs breakdown vs. what they actually spend on programs?
Persuader: if you go to save the children.com you can find all of that information 
	Persuadee: Ah.. I see, you misspelled the charity at the beginning. I was wondering why you were talking about ""save the hold ten"" vs. ""save the children.""
Persuader: Sorry, typo!!  If you would like to donate, it can come right out if your task mon y today
	Persuadee: As I recall, for save the children, they were given a bad reputation back in the '90s due to their excessive spending on administration costs vs. program expenditures. It was quite the scandal and they became a watchword for bad charities.
Persuader: I believe they have gotten better the last few years!  Would you like to donate 
	Persuadee: No, there are other charities that do a much better job in my opinion that I already donate to, such as Compassion International and World Vision for international children's relief, and my local food shelter. I can participate directly through volunteer hours and I can also actually visit the children that I help through my family's donations. That's a big plus for me.
Persuader: Are you sure, you can do as little as 5 cents???
	Persuadee: Amounts don't matter to me. Ethical charities do. I'm sorry, but I contributed to save the children back in the day before the scandal broke. I'm afraid for me, their reputation is still bad. Sorry, no.
Persuader:  URL Is there website!  You can check them out 
	Persuadee: Actually, their own website may be a biased barometer of their giving. Perhaps a link to an organization or other agency that rates major charities would be more helpful.
Persuader: Ok, I disagree with you but see your point 
	Persuadee: Believe me, if it were any charity besides ""save the children,"" you could have me donate my entire compensation, which isn\'t really all that much.

	Persuadee: I sure do!
Persuader: Great.  I like this charity called Save the Children.  Have you heard of them?
	Persuadee: I think that I have seen ads on tv for it.  It helps impoverished children in developing countries, I believe.
Persuader: Yes they help children in developing countries with a lot of different things.   It's surprising how much less these children have.
	Persuadee: Yes, I think they do a lot of good.  Do you donate to them?
Persuader: I do donate to them.  Do you donate to any charities?
	Persuadee: I donate occasionally.  I did last year after the devastating hurricanes that hit the south.  Houston, specifically.
Persuader: Yeah I always have certain charities that speak to me.  You are able to donate a portion of your earning from this to Save the Children if they interest you.
	Persuadee: Hmm, I am not sure if I will do that.  It is tough to know if a little bit would make any difference.
Persuader: Any little bit helps...if everyone gives even 10 cents, that adds up.
	Persuadee: What would you do?
Persuader: I like to donate a little bit when I'm asked.  Especially since it's tax deductible.
	Persuadee: That is good to know!  I do forget that I can deduct charitable contributions.  I am thinking I may donate a little.
Persuader: Yeah and making small donations throughout the year adds up...makes a good tax deduction.
	Persuadee: Okay, then.  I believe that I will donate ten cents.
Persuader: That's great!  You can always read up on them to see where your donation will go.  Over 80% of it goes directly to helping the children.

	Persuadee: I am doing well, how are you?
Persuader: Decent, bit of a slow start to the morning on Turk but it is the weekend so I guess that's expected
	Persuadee: I'm new to this so I have no idea what to expect.  How long have you been doing it?
Persuader: I've been working this for almost two years now. The busier season is starting as the colleges in the US will be started/starting soon so that helps
	Persuadee: So obviously it's worth it for you.  Do you just do it in your spare time?
Persuader: Yea it's definitely worth it to me. I do some at my work on days when its slow but mostly just in my off time instead of going on social media or something I come here
	Persuadee: I guess it's a lot better way to waste time than seeing what a bunch of people I don't really care about are doing.  So when college is in there's less competition?  
Persuader: Haha exactly! When college is in session we get more studies/surveys posted as a lot of the work on Turk is done for academic reasons. So in the next couple weeks we'll see an influx of students doing their psychology studies and such via the platform.
	Persuadee: Oh man, I didn't even think of that.  They have all the grant money to throw out too.  So how much time do you throw at this in a given week?
Persuader: It varies but generally a few hours on my workdays and maybe like 6 or 8 on my days off I'd say
	Persuadee: That's pretty good.  I don't have that kind of time.  Any suggestions for a newcomer?
Persuader: On the task page sort so you see the newest HITs, and grab whatever looks good to you as far as surveys. I'd recommend being wary of doing multiple HITs for any 1 requestor until you vet them yourself because rejections early on in a Turk account can make getting better hits tough (a lot of the better hits require 99% or higher approval rating) - and remember you'll get a lot faster at it as you keep going, it can feel a bit slow and tough at the beginning but it does get better
	Persuadee: Thanks, the last few days have been pretty boring, I was hoping to see more progress.  Are sureveys the way to go?  I've seen a lot of the website searching stuff too?  Is that stuff worth it?
Persuader: Website searching can be good, it never hurts to try a HIT once - see how fast you can complete it and decide if it\'s worth doing more from there. One other cool thing about MTurk is that some studies allow you to donate money to a charitable cause directly from the task payment - This one we\'re doing now in fact allows us to donate towards a foundation called ""Save the Children""
	Persuadee: Oh really?  Where do you see that?
Persuader: At the end of the study they will ask if you'd like to donate from your payment to the foundation, they assist needy children all around the globe in dire situations. Would you be willing to donate any of your payment today to help save the kids?
	Persuadee: I think so.  How do you see where the donation goes?  
Persuader: It will tell you in a short blurb above the box to donate (I've done this HIT before in the past) and the researchers ensure 100% of any amount you donate goes to the kids. Even a small donation makes a big difference because there are so many of us making small amounts that it really adds up!

	Persuadee: I do, but I also know that Carolyn Myles, the CEO, takes a nearly half million dollar annual salary.
Persuader: Oh wow, where did you hear that?
	Persuadee: You can find more information about that on their Charity Navigator page.  They also have a troubling liability to asset number that makes me worry about their overall financial viability as a charity.
Persuader: That's a bummer to hear about because I'm supposed to persuade you to donate some of your payment from this task to that charity.
	Persuadee: Yeah, they pick odd charities on here.  Save the Children isn't awful, really, it's just a charity I run into a lot.
Persuader: Oh haha. I haven't done this before. Anyway. I'm supposed to ask you: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).
	Persuadee: 0 dollars, but I'll give the 2 to The Global Orphan Project on my own time because I think that's in spirit of this HIT
Persuader: That's awesome! I don't really trust gigantic charities either. Do you know what we do now?
	Persuadee: No, there's a message number we have to hit I think.  But I can tell you how fostering affected me and my family.  My half sister was born to a mentally ill mother and our shared father is abusive, so she was in foster care for a number of years.  Charities like this are really important to me because they helped her get in touch with me when she was older.
Persuader: That's so great. It's good to just give to what we are personally invested in!

Persuader: Well it's called Save the Children, fairly self-explanatory. The organization is myself and my Dad. We work out of our house.
	Persuadee: Nice, does it have any website?
Persuader: Yes but you have to access it with the Tor browser as our work is very private.
	Persuadee: Actually I\'ve read about ""Save the Children"" as far as i know it is an international organization working in 120 countries, how is it so private?
Persuader: Oh, that's a different organization set up by my twin brother Morton. Just forget you've seen that.
	Persuadee: so there are 2 different organization with same names?
Persuader: Yes. Well sort of. Due to litigation we\'ve had to add ""Harder"" to our name. So we are Save the Children Harder.
	Persuadee: are you joking with me? Because an organization should be transparent with its financial reports. If you say it is very secret people wont trust.
Persuader: This is no joke sir/madame. Our work will bring children to the next stage of development! A stage with no hunger at all!
	Persuadee: I will donate at the end of the task anyway. But you can't tell people there is a private website and we work secretly and people should help us. People like to help transparent organization. I did this HIT few times and I was on the other side of conversation too. I never claimed the organization belongs to me.

Persuader: How about this story: I'm actually not just a representative of Save the Children, but a child myself. A child who needs saving. And I think you... you are the one who can. My responses were a test, you see?

Persuader: Save the Children donates nearly 90% of every dollar to their mission.  They are very upfront with letting you know where your donation is going.
	Persuadee: Can I choose where my donation is sent to?
Persuader: Yes not only are you able to choose.  You have the ability to take part in their Sponsor A Child program by either choosing someone in the US or in another country.  I love the idea of staying connected to one or two so that i can see the progress and how I can specifically make a difference.
	Persuadee: Do I have to make recurring payments?
Persuader: There's multiple ways to make payments.  Although recurring payments are recommended, it is completely optional.  Would you consider Sponsoring a Child on a long term basis during college?
	Persuadee: Possibly. I'm not sure if I can afford a long term plan.
Persuader: The great thing about Save the Children they have the option to even send a gift such as a water kit, a soccer ball and even a rabbit.  I really like this idea because it makes it not all about the money.
	Persuadee: That's very nice, I like the idea of sending food or water.
Persuader: Yes, it is so sad that we have children that still are in need of food and water.  As a single parent of 5 children, I know how rough it can get to provide even the basics but I am still moved to help others because of my own experiences.  Many don't realize just a little can go a long ways.

Persuader: Totally understandable. We all have our own obligations in our personal lives.  Do you mind if I ask you if you have ever gone with out food, shelter, or the basic necessities?
	Persuadee: I have been nearly homeless at a point in my life.  That is why I donate money to help take care of others, pay it forward if you will.
Persuader: Exactly, I myself have been homeless, gone to bed without food as a child,  had no heat or water in the dead of winter, which is why supporting Save the Children is so important! Just 1 donation could potentially change a child's opportunities in life!
	Persuadee: Have you donated?
Persuader: Absolutely.  Just like you mentioned earlier, I believe in pay
	Persuadee: I am glad we are both able to help.  I just have already helped another organization this month and live paycheck to paycheck as it is.  I'm sure you understand.
Persuader: My apology, I hit the enter button prematurely.  But I absolutely agree in paying it forward. I wholehartedly agree that our purpose in life is to be a blessing for someone else when we can.  Would you be willing to donate to the charity now? 
	Persuadee: I really can't.
Persuader: You mentioned earlier that you live paycheck to paycheck, I am in the exact same boat. But did you know that your donation can be directly deducted from your task payment?  You can choose any amount from O to $2.

Persuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save The Children.

Persuader: I'm in a small town in Iowa outside of the quad cities. Have you ever heard of a charity called Save the Children?
	Persuadee: I can't say that I have heard of that particular non-profit, but it sounds interesting. Is that charity something you feel passionate about?
Persuader: It's an amazing organization that does a lot of work internationally. It's a non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: That sounds like a great cause. How can I help?
Persuader: That's so awesome that you want to help out! You can choose to donate any amount of the task payment, $0-$2 or anything in between. How much would you like to donate to the charity now?
	Persuadee: $2 for me, please
Persuader: Thank you so much! The children will benefit so greatly from your donation
	Persuadee: Cool, no prob. I work in philanthropy, so it is important.

	Persuadee: :) It's a really great uni, but of course, I am highly biased. I want more people to be able to go here. 
Persuader: I agree. Its getting so expensive now days that it seems like the trend isn't to go to college anymore but more a trade school
	Persuadee: And that's okay, too. For the best and brightest, there should always be the 40 Acres. 
Persuader: I agree. Everyone's path is different but I think going to a big school offers those who have no clue what to do a good place to find out, or if they know exactly what they want they can pick the best program
	Persuadee: Agreed. We've done a lot better here, diversifying our programs and adding interdisciplinary studies. I'm sort of envious of the college kids of today.

	Persuadee: Could you tell me more about it?
Persuader: You can donate as little or as much as you want. It is to help children in need all over the world.
	Persuadee: I am guessing this a charity?
Persuader: Yes. I'm Sorry. it is for charity. I thought I mentioned that.
	Persuadee: No, its fine!  This is a non-profit charity, not government sponsored?
Persuader: It is a Non-Profit Charity

Persuader: so far so good thanks! I'd like to talk to you about an NGO I know if that's alright with you?
	Persuadee: yeah sure! What NGO?
Persuader: Have you heard of Save the Children? I know a lot of organizations do amazing work overseas - they are one that focuses specifically on helping ensure children have rights to education, health, and safety
	Persuadee: I have never heard of them actually, but thats awesome! Education, health and safety are key points that I think are very important to the less fortunate children overseas.
Persuader: I agree - certainly important for everyone, but often its the kids who can\'t speak for themselves that have the hardest time accessing the things they need. Between working with immediate disaster relief (like post hurricane Harvey) or longer term issues - like improving access to clean water in Cambodia, and they are on the ""Wise Giving"" award from Better Business Bureau - which measures how well funds get to the charitable work (versus expensive staff, etc)
	Persuadee: Wow. I actaully never knew that the BBB had such a thing to measure that sort of implication. I do know in fact that many NGO's out there do not use the money for the actual mission they are seeking. 
Persuader: I think that's why BBB set it up - it's an accreditation for charities to make sure people know how funds are being spent. Have you ever donated to a charity doing work like this?
	Persuadee: I have donated to The Hunger Project, in which they seek to mobilize permanent programs to end world hunger. Missions are mostly in rural areas of Africa, Latin America and Asia. What about you?
Persuader: I have with Save the Children and Habitat for Humanity. I even went on a trip with Habitat to Malawi which was amazing. The researchers of this study have given participants the ability to donate a portion of the payment to Save the Children. Would you be willing to donate? 77 cents shelters a refugee for a day
	Persuadee: Of course! I will donate $1.54! Thank you for telling me that.
Persuader: you're welcome - thank you for your donation - I really appreciate it!
	Persuadee: Your very welcome! I am happy to donate to a good cause. 
Persuader: I understand that this chat is complete once I\'ve shared details, and you\'ve either committed to donate, or decided to decline today. I also understand a ""10 minimum chat turns"" which I think we have hit. Is there anything you think we need to do before hitting ""return""?
	Persuadee: I am at 7 chat turns unfortunately. 
Persuader: that's okay - I am glad I asked because I thought they meant 10 total, but you're right - it might be 10 EACH

	Persuadee: Yeah, i'm glad there are organizations to help children, since they can't really help themselves. What are some of the more nameworthy charities you can think of? We have St Judes Childrens Hospital rather close to here as well as several different charities for all kinds of needs
Persuader: YEAH,SOME OF THEM CAN'T REALLY HELP FOR THE CHARITY.BUT SOMEONE GIVE'S THEIR HANDS FOR THEM
	Persuadee: Yes, you definitely got to be on the look out for false charities. I use resources like Charity Navigator for this. Have you heard of it? It provides a non-biased ""grade"" for charities based on how thruthful they are as well as how well they manage their funds. It helps me make the right choices and not just throw my money away
Persuader: YES I HEARD ABOUT THAT.EVERYONE SHOULD AWAKENED AND GIVES CHARITIES TO THEM
	Persuadee: Definitely. Do you donate to charities ever? I am not financially well-off, but I try to give forward what I can. At grocery stores or supermarkets they usually have those Helping Hand charities or something similar and I usually give my change to them. It has to count for something, hopefully..
Persuader: YES I DONATE TO MANY CHARITIES. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NOT FINANCIALLY WELL OFF GIVE A SINGLE DOLLAR IS HELP THEM TO SATISFIED FOR FOOD
	Persuadee: Yeah definitely. President Obama did the same sort of thing with ""Grassroots"" Fundraising. Instead of getting a few really large donations, he was able to get several millions of small donations to fund his presidential campaign. It shows the power of small amounts of money. Charities rely on funds to keep doing their work so I think it\'s important to help when possible. I always told myself if I am ever more financially secure in the future, I would help as much as possible.
Persuader:  THAT'S GOOD TO DO
	Persuadee: Thank you. Do you also have charities soliciting money in grocery stores and gas stations or banks around you?

Persuader: Since this is a nonprofit organzation all donations will go directly to a trustable fund.  There are no payments toward adminstrative purposes.  Once the funds reach a certain limit (from various donators) they will then be used to purchase supplies, food, etc all for the children
	Persuadee: Is safe the children only children in America?
