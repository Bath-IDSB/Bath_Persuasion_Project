	Persuadee: Pretty good, whats going on today?
Persuader: not much.  do you donate to any charities
	Persuadee: I do, I love helping out people in need or need something to help them get going.
Persuader: How about donating to Save the children?
	Persuadee: It sounds like a great cause, can you tell me about it?
Persuader: Yes, the money helps children with clothing, food and school
	Persuadee: That all sounds wonderful, I would love to donate to that.
Persuader: Howmuch do you think you can donate
	Persuadee: I want to donate 1.50 to help the children get better lives.
Persuader: That's great.  So wonderful for you to do that.
	Persuadee: Yeah, the kids will really benefit from everyones help.
Persuader: Would you like to maybe donate 1.75 instead of 1.50?
	Persuadee: Hmm ya I can help .25 cents more.
Persuader: Have you donated to this cause before?
	Persuadee: No I havent, this is my first time hearing about it.
Persuader: So glad you decided to donate.  This will really help

Persuader: Do you think you will continue to donate to this charity
	Persuadee: Yeah I will donate on the regular.",False,1.0
114,"Persuader: Hey, how are you doing, have you ever heard of a charity called Save the Children?
	Persuadee: No I havent. What is it about?
Persuader: It's an international organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries, does that sound like something you'd get behind?
	Persuadee: No thank you.
Persuader: May I ask why? Your help could really make a difference in a child's life, think of a child who didn't have enough to eat, just a small bit of help may have saved them, are you sure you're not interested?
	Persuadee: I am already making a difference in many children lives.
Persuader: That's great, it sounds like it's an issue you really care about then, why not put some of that effort into a charity that's doing really great work like Save the Children?
	Persuadee: I have donated 15 years of my life to charity
Persuader: I'm not asking you to donate years of your life, just a couple of cents if possible, is that something you could possibly do tonight?
	Persuadee: No thank you
Persuader: You're probably on a computer right now, so you probably have quite a bit of money yourself, don't you think you could spare maybe 25 cents for some needy children around the world?
	Persuadee: No thank you
Persuader: Do you have children yourself? What if your children were in a position these kids are in, wouldn't you want someone to help them?
	Persuadee: Where are those childrens parent?
Persuader: If only they had parental support, but in war-torn countries like Syria their parents are being killed in wars or are fighting for their country, they have no help and that's why they need your support, please find it in your heart to just give a little bit tonight, that's all I'm asking.
	Persuadee: My small change won't do a thing for those kids. What they need is to be extracted from those countries so that they can have a better life not 0.25.
Persuader: Well with our current president it's not likely they're going to be brought the US, so they need any help they can get, and 25 cents might not seem like a lot, but if 10000 people donated 25 cents then the impact will be huge. I understand it may not seem like a lot, but it can really make a difference. You can donate some or all of your payment from this task to Save the Children, i'd really appreciate it if you did, but I understand if you still don't want to. What do you say? 
	Persuadee: If it makes you happy, go ahead and take .50

Persuader: I am, Save the Children is a wonderful, greatly needed charity. Donations to this charity are essential to ensure at-risk children receive health care, education, safety and much more. 
	Persuadee: So nice job. I also like to save the children.
Persuader: That is wonderful! I just wanted to make you aware that you have the opportunity to donate a portion, or all of your payment from this task to Save the Children. This donation will aid in giving at-risk children a chance for hope. 
	Persuadee: Yes I also like to donate to the children without parents and relatives.
Persuader: Wonderful. I'm glad to know you agree with Save the Children's values. Before I ask you for the amount you'd like to donate I want to give you a bit more info about the charity and answer any questions you might have. Save the Children has received top ratings for achieving incredible results for children. Save the Children does what it promises. 
	Persuadee: I like to donate. But I don't have money to donate.
Persuader: You would choose an amount from the money you make completing this task. Your donation would make a difference to children among 120 countries, including the United States.
	Persuadee: I like to donate 50 dollars. What about you?
Persuader: That is a generous donation! But I believe that exceeds what you will receive for this task. You can choose an amount anywhere from $0 - $0.30 
	Persuadee: I choose 0.30 dollar for donation
Persuader: Awesome! I want to let you know that your donation will be collected by the research team and will send it to Save the Children. Do you have any other questions about the charity?
	Persuadee: Ok if you need means you take that amount.
Persuader: Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. Save the Children assists these children with their education, protection and emergency programs.
	Persuadee: We must help the children to give education.
Persuader: Yes we must. Your .30 donation will certainly assist these children. Save the Children is also transforming the lives of Africa's children.

	Persuadee: Great! How are you doing?
Persuader: I am well. What are your plans for the day?
	Persuadee: i will be working all day.
Persuader: Yes, I am getting ready for work as well. Have you heard of the charity called Save the Children?
	Persuadee: No I have not
Persuader: It is a US based charity that helps kids by collecting money to help supply them with their basic needs like healthcare, food, and clothing. Today I am asking if you would consider even a small donation to STC, even $0.05 would help. Can the kids count on you?
	Persuadee: $0.05? that is not bad I could probably do that.
Persuader: Thank you! Everything really helps out. Have you heard about the recent storms in Hawaii?
	Persuadee: I kind of saw some stuff about them on the news.
Persuader: Well, STC has already pledged to help the kids in Hawaii. They do not waste any time and they get right to the world's problems. I know I would feel horrible if any kids in my family/extended family were suffering. Do you have kids in your family/extended family?
	Persuadee: yes I have two a boy and a girl.
Persuader: So you really understand kids! I like this charity because they make it so easy to give any amount. Were you interested in their website info?

Persuader: I already have you down for $0.05. Were you willing to pledge more?
	Persuadee: i will donate 0.10 today
Persuader: That is fantastic! They are US based, the US office is located in CT. The site tells of all the areas getting help, including war torn areas as well. It also details how people can sponsor individual kids. It is a  great organization, don't you agree?
	Persuadee: yes sounds great.
Persuader: I agree, it really is. It breaks my heart to know that while I have so much freedom there are kids that look at a simple meal as a lifesaving chance. So I have you down for $0.10, right?
	Persuadee: That is correct.",False,0.1
117,"Persuader: Hello! How are you?
	Persuadee: Fine. What do you know about the charity? What have you heard people say or have seen online about the charity?
Persuader: Save the Children helps provide essential basic needs providing for their health, safety, and education internationally. 
	Persuadee: Have you gone to a charity rating site to check on it? I have not. I want to be assured that overhead costs are minimized.
Persuader: As of Feb 2018 they were rated 97% transparant and an 88% total rating. They save children from horrible fates like starvation. Something simple and easy to fix. No child should ever lose their life for lack of food.
	Persuadee: I'd prefer a secure food donation that directly transports to the areas the children live in instead of handing over to government officials. I feel that using money to but food directly in their cities is best.
Persuader: Save the Children donations go straight to the needy. There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence
	Persuadee: I am willing to agree to 5 percent of my income for 6 months about 800 dollars.
Persuader: That is incredibly generous! We all play a role in helping this cause save lives. ""How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.

	Persuadee: No. Can you help me with that.
Persuader: It is a charity that helps ensure children's basic rights to health, education, safety, etc
	Persuadee: Okay. It's a very noble cause.
Persuader: Children in other countries don't have the advantages that we do such as access to the internet
	Persuadee: Yeah totally agreed. Even they are not able to get good meal and got suffered from many malnutrition diseases.
Persuader: Yes, it is a very noble cause
	Persuadee: But we can't help them directly. Most of time we have to depend on someone to help them.
Persuader: I would liek to ask if you would want to make  small donation to this cause
	Persuadee: I already did for some websites. Not interested right now to do so. Give me your details i will send you later on.

	Persuadee: Hi
Persuader: My name is Ren, how are you today?
	Persuadee: Hi Ren! I am doing fairly well, thank you.
Persuader: I see we should discuss a social issue. How do you feel about struggling children in developing countries?
	Persuadee: I feel sad for all children that have to struggle; no matter where they are from.
Persuader: I feel the same way! I saw this clip today that just broke my heart
	Persuadee: What type of clip was it? Were the children without family and the necessary tools to survive?
Persuader: It was one of those emotional videos, showing children and their families without food and other necessities. It got me thinking of how I can help.
	Persuadee: That is sad. There are so many people in this world that don't have money, so they have to rely on other people to help them. I see homeless people here, and sometimes try to help them out also.
Persuader: My heart just goes out to them. Would you be willing to donate a portion of your bonus to these children?
	Persuadee: What organization would be receiving the donation?
Persuader: Save the Children. The research team can organize for them to receive it. I am also going to donate half of my bonus to them. Things add up and can make a difference in someone's life. Will you help us?
	Persuadee: It\'s very hard to not be leery about about online donations; but in this case, I would donation a portion to this cause. Can you tell me a little more about ""Save the Children""?
Persuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. 
	Persuadee: You seem to know a lot about this organization; have you made donations to this cause previously?
Persuader: Actually I haven't. I was just looking for a way to make a contribution and found them. The researchers for this study will handle the monetary contribution. These days you really have to be careful of sending money to anyone. I figured that since this is a bonus, we wouldn't even have to give any credit card information, it's perfect. How much do you like to donate to the charity? I'm giving a dollar! 
	Persuadee: I think I have an amount in mind; do you know what percentage of all donations actually go directly to the cause?
Persuader: All proceeds donated will be given to the charity. We really have to help each other in this world. Thank you so much for our talk today and your donation. Hopefully other opportunities will allow us to be more effective in changing the world around us!
	Persuadee: It was interesting talking to you, do you donate often to charities?

Persuader: Good to hear, do anything special over the weekend
	Persuadee: Not really, just gym and some brief grocery shopping. Just a very typical weekend for me.
Persuader: Cool, it's just been a relaxing weekend for me.  Have you donated to any charities this year
	Persuadee: Yes. I donated to the RAICES charity for the immigrants separated from their children.
Persuader: sorry my tablet just disconnected for a minute.  Are you aware of what is going on in Syria?
	Persuadee: Oh yes, I hear about it and read about it on a regular basis.
Persuader: Ok so you know that their is a lot of children in danger in those war torn areas.
	Persuadee: Yes, it's heartbreaking to hear about.
Persuader: It really is! There is a charity that is focusing on helping children in these areas like Syria and they are known as Save the Children Foundation.
	Persuadee: I have heard of them.
Persuader: You and I have the chance to help them out by using some or all of the money we make from this task.  Are you willing to donate a certain amount?
	Persuadee: I would prefer to donate my money to UNICEF.
Persuader: UNICEF is a great charity as well, but our donations should be focused on Save the Children if that is okay.  I mean UNICEF is very well known and they do great work but right now there is trouble for these children.  For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
	Persuadee: I don't quite see the difference between the two. Save the Children has had some issues as of late.
Persuader: What issues would those be?
	Persuadee: Please visit their Wikipedia page and click on controversies.
Persuader: Is Wikipedia a trusted source?
	Persuadee: It provides sources to other sites based on the page.
Persuader: Wikipedia is written by average joes.  How much would you like to donate.  It is okay if you decline.  If you agree to donate to Save the Children I will match your donation as well.
	Persuadee: That is a fair point, but I think a Google search will also lead to issues. Not to say UNICEF is totally problem free, but it's not a like typical charity a la Save the Children. I would not like to donate at this time, but thank you.

121,"Persuader: Hello!
	Persuadee: Hello
Persuader: So it looks like you have the option to donate some of your earnings from this task to Save the Children. Have you heard of that charity before?
	Persuadee: Know I have not. Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries. It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc.
	Persuadee: Okay. What is the organization called?
Persuader: It's called Save the Children. It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat. It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat. Do you donate much to charity now?
	Persuadee: O I have heard of Save the children. I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity. Currently I do not donate to charities. I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget. I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.
Persuader: I understand. I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend. I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday. However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out. It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.
	Persuadee: I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today. I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.
Persuader: I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding. If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation
	Persuadee: Okay. So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?
Persuader: Yes, I believe so. Based on what I'm reading in the directions, you'd donate from the earnings you'd get from doing this task
	Persuadee: Okay that is nice and simple. 
Persuader: Absolutely! I agree. I really enjoy when things like this are easy to do. I don't know how much time we have left to chat, but it's been great to (electronically) meet you!
	Persuadee: It has been great to electronically meet you too. I am not sure how much time we have left and I don't know what to next ha ha.
Persuader: Oh wait, we need at least 10 minimum chat turns. So we'll need to chat a little bit more about donations; is there any particular issue going on with children in the world today that you've been following in the news or that you care more about?
	Persuadee: So when it comes to issues, a specific issue that I really care about is the problem with the poverty issue in the United States. To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children. For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?
Persuader: I agree. I grew up in California, lived in Louisiana, and then moved to Massachusetts. There's different kinds of childhood poverty between those three states and I wish there was more I could do to help. If you're an adult and you're homeless it's a very different situation than being 6 years old and homeless. We talk a lot about children in other countries, but there's a lot of need for American children too. I'm hoping you'll keep half for you and your own child, and half for Save the Children too!
	Persuadee: That is cool that you lived in three different states. Before I lived in New Mexico I also lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota. There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,  New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.  I completely agree with you. I feel like our country does not focus enough on our issue with poverty. Especially with children. The issue with children poverty has to change.I will take the option of donating into consideration.

	Persuadee: It bothers me a lot, I try to do my bits, mostly trying to raise awareness, but it is far from enough. I feel powerless, even the idea of donating a few dollars seem meaningless when you know that there are people who could literally donate billions. 
Persuader: Honestly, just that little bit could provide a lot to places like that. I know it's hard to believe but it's true, I've seen it first hand. Plus, by donating it to a place as credible as Save the Children, you know its going where its needed.
	Persuadee: Do you know if there is any research done on that? I do believe that you speak the truth, but it would be easier to convince people with actual numbers. I legitimately believe that amassing too much money is wrong, and mathematically it is ridiculous,  the owner of amazon donating half of his wealth would be the same as each person in the world donating 10 dollars. And he would still be 80 billion dollars rich.
Persuader: Absolutely, I understand. One of the really cool things about this organization is that you can very easily access their financial records and revenue on their website, and you are more than welcome to look that up at  URL but if you were to donate even a fraction of your earnings from this HIT, 86% of that would actually go to the services they are providing for this children in impoverished countries
	Persuadee: I'll take a look at it, what happens to the other 14%?
Persuader: 9% goes toward fundraising and the other 5% goes toward management and other expenses of the actually organization 
	Persuadee: Yeah, I saw that, last year they made 155 million. Literally 0.1% of Bezos's wealth. Sorry, I'm very salty about this, but you get the point.
Persuader: Of course, I understand. The rich stay rich. But, not to be pushy, would you like to donate any of the money you would receive for this HIT to this organization?
	Persuadee: Sure, it doesn't make sense to complain and not to donate. I'd like to donate all of it, the excuse of the whole bureaucracy I usually use is not valid here. Thanks for the opportunity.

Persuader: I don't know much about the specific charity, but I'm a mom, and I think it's really important to help kids around the world.  From what I've heard, Save the Children is a great organization that really makes a different.  I've read they've been doing a lot of work in Syria. 
	Persuadee: What charity are you talking about?
Persuader: The info that I'm seeing on my end is that we can choose to donate part of what we earn in this task to Save the Children.  It's a large philanthropic organization that works on ensuring children's rights to health, education, and safety.  They have apparently done work recently to help children in Syria impacted by the civil war.  
	Persuadee: Do you know how long they've been around?
Persuader: I don't see any exact date.  However, they have done work to improve access to education, medicine, and food in Darfur and appear to have been working when that area was also impacted by civil war.  
	Persuadee: Thanks, what are your contribution plans?
Persuader: I am debating between 50% and all of the bonus.  So between 1 and 2 dollars.  I think even $1 can make a difference in their efforts.  What about you?
	Persuadee: I'm thinking about the same
Persuader: I think that seems fair.  From the description, they seem to have a pretty low overhead so even $1 will go directly toward the charitable efforts.  They've also apparently been involved in Jimmy Carter's organization that seeks to give kids and families clean water by getting rid of the guinea worm.  The water filters they use only cost $.90
	Persuadee: Thanks for those details, I'd give a dollar to help.
Persuader: Sounds like a good plan. So that $1 will be deducted from the payment.  My instructions say the research team will send all the donations directly.
	Persuadee: OK, they're making it easy to help
Persuader: Yes - I think that's nice.  They are making it an easy task for us!
