	Persuadee: Hi! I am doing well, thank you. And you?
Persuader: I'm doing well. Thank you for asking. I have a question for you on this fine evening. How do you feel about the children's charity, Save the Children?
	Persuadee: I don't know a lot about it, but from what I do know, they seem like a generous organization. 
Persuader: I have been thinking of donating to this charity recently. Have you ever thought of donating?
	Persuadee: I have, yes. 
Persuader: What kind of organizations do you see yourself donating to?
	Persuadee: I donate to St Jude every year. I have a special place in my heart for children's organizations. 
Persuader: Yes St Jude's is a very nice organzation. I remember as a kid growing up, my catholic grammar school would always raise money for them. Save the Children is just like St Jude's as well as they go all over the world to help a lot of children in need. 
	Persuadee: That's really awesome they help children all over the world. Do they provide medical assistance as St Jude's does
Persuader: Yes they do. Save the Children gives a lot of medical assistance to children all over the world. They are responisble for giving many poor children vaccines. A lot of children around the world often don't have the vaccines that richer countries have to fight off preventable diseases.
	Persuadee: I've heard they play a big part in education around the world too. Do they assist children here in the US as well?
Persuader: Yes they do. Unfortunately there is a lot of poor children in the USA that aren't getting the right resources and Save the Children is doing the best they can to help them out just like St Judes/
	Persuadee: Very good to hear. How much of the donations actually go directly to the kids? Unfortunately not all organizations use the majority of their donations to directly fund programs. 
Persuader: That is true but a lot of the money from Save the Children goes to help out the kids. A lot of people needed to be helped and millions have been helped by Save The Children
	Persuadee: Glad they are a trustworthy organization. I see myself donating to them in the future.
Persuader: Yes they are a very reliable organization that has been around for a long time. Millions have truly been helped by them. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? You can donate some of your HIT reward towards them.

	Persuadee: I agree. I think I will look into adding this to what I donate during the year.
Persuader: it is certainly a great one, they really make sure the money goes where its needed vs in someone's pockets from the charity.

	Persuadee: Very well, how are you doing?
Persuader: Im fine, have you heard about Save the Children charity?
	Persuadee: I don't know anything about that, is it like Make A Wish?
Persuader: Sort of, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: That sounds very worthwhile. Does it help any children in the United States also?
Persuader: Mostly developing countries where the help is needed most, would you like to donate part of your reward for this task?
	Persuadee: I would like to learn more about this charity before I commit to a donation. I also would be interested in a charity that assists children in the United States also, There is a great need here too
Persuader: Thats great but I only can speak on Save the Children, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. That's why it's important to help these children that can use your help.
	Persuadee: I understand. It sounds like a very worthwhile cause and one that is desperately needed in that country. How do the funds reach the children?
Persuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.
	Persuadee: I see. And then how does it actually get implemented? 
Persuader: Save the Children donations is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc
	Persuadee: Right I get that, but how does the money actually get to the children themselves. Does it go to the parents and the parents use it to take care of children?
Persuader: No it doesn't work that way, like I said on the last message the money goes into ensuring the rights to health, education, safety etc. It does go directly into their pockets, it goes into advancing their life. How much would you like to donate?
	Persuadee: I am not sure I am ready to donate at this time. Can you tell me what percentage of the donated money goes to administrative costs
Persuader: 0 it all goes to the charity 100%, would you like to donate and help a child get an opportunity to have a better life?

625,"Persuader: Hello, I would like to tell you a little bit about an organization that I feel very strongly about. The organization is called Save The Children. Would it be okay if I told you a little bit about what we do?
	Persuadee: Sure, please continue and tell me
Persuader: Save The Children is an organization that helps ensure children's rights to helth, safety, education, etc. We are looking for donations to help these children who are in need. 
	Persuadee: How do they help ensure these things? 
Persuader: Across the United States, one in five children are born into poverty. This affects the education that these children desperatly need. With donating to Save The Children, we use the donations to provide head start learning programs to those who may not get it. We also help with school-aged children, helping them get the proper education they need to prepare for kindergarten. This program gets children off on the right foot. 
	Persuadee: Sounds like a good program
Persuader: Think about natural disasters, hurricane Katrina, for example. When this hurricane hit, thousands of people lost their homes. Children, being the most vulnerable in times such as this. When this happened, Save The Children stepped in. We sent out rescue teams, emergency crews, and gave these children a safe place to stay, learn, and play. This is one of the many examples that we do. If you donate to Save The Children today, even as little as a few cents, you would be a part of saving these children and ensuring a great future for them.
	Persuadee: Sounds like you've done a lot, where else has that organization gone? 
Persuader: We are currently working with several crisis around the world. One of the many is in Somalia. They have been going through a hunger and famine crisis. This is the worst drought they have had in nearly 70 years. With the help of donations, Save The Children has been able to send over supplies, food, and fresh drinking water to help out the nearly 10 million families and children in need. 
	Persuadee: What percentage of donations goes towards relief efforts?
Persuader: 9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to services and families in need. in 2017, 86% of the donations we recieved went to program services. 
	Persuadee: What other services are offered? 
Persuader: Here in the US, we offer education, emergency relief, and protection programs. But, we don't stop there. We also offer global servies, including health, education, protection, emergency, and hunger programs.
	Persuadee: Does the program make a lot of money?
Persuader: The programs are free to those who need them. We are not an organization that profits anything. The money that we have that does not go towards the programs, go to the costs of the fundraising and managment
	Persuadee: Are there many who work for your organization?
Persuader: Everybody is a voulenteer that works for our organization. But, many who do not have the time to voulenteer often give donations. Today, to complete this task, you are given money to complete this task. The money you recieve could really go a long way in our organization. If you choose to donate, your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You could choose any amount from $0, to all of your payment. Even the sligtest amount would help. How much would you like to donate to Save The Children?

	Persuadee: Good morning!  How are you doing today?
Persuader: I am good! I am trying to get my friends and others to donate their payment from this task to Save the Children. Save the Children is reputable and every dollar they raise goes to feed families.
	Persuadee: What else can you tell me about the charity?  Which countries do they work in?
Persuader: Save the Children works for 18 countries in Africa, 5 countries in the Middle East and India and Pakistan. 
	Persuadee: How much of a donation would one have to make to feed a family for a week?
Persuader: 5.00 a week would feed one family for a week. Do you spend 5.00 a week on a coffee?
	Persuadee: That's crazy! I spend more than that on coffee every week!  
Persuader: Then would you be willing to donate all of the money you make on this hit to the organization? You could always donate more. It is our moral responsibility to help feed the hungry.
	Persuadee: I would do that
Persuader: That's awesome! We are so lucky to live in a country where there is help available to us such as Medicaid, food banks and other organizations to help us. It is so unfair that any person in any country can go hungry,
	Persuadee: We really are.  We have SO many places to go to for help
Persuader: Yes, we do. I hope that each of us can make a conscious decision to start donating some of our paychecks each week to help children and families around the world.
	Persuadee: I'm going to tell more people about the charity
Persuader: That is great!! That is what we need! Do you live in the United States?
	Persuadee: Yes, I do
Persuader: Me too! I am going to Kenya in December and I may try to see if there is anywhere there that I can donate some money. Wait, I should just go through Save the Children since I know they are reputable.
	Persuadee: I always prefer going through organizations I have researched to make sure they're reputable as well

	Persuadee: I'm doing great! how about yourself?
Persuader: I'm doing really well.  I was wondering how familiar you are with the effect all the intensifying violence in the world is having on children?
	Persuadee: I'm very familiar with the effect that violence is having on children. Having a younger brother myself I get to see it first hand.
Persuader: Wow. How old is he? What part of the world are you from? In a lot of places because of war and poverty there are just no resources for these kids in danger.
	Persuadee: my brother is 9 years old and we live in the southern part of The United States of America.
Persuader: Have you heard of the organization ""Save the Children?""
	Persuadee: No I have not. What can you tell me about it?
Persuader: They are a group dedicated to helping children in danger and need around the world.  They help everywhere from the Rohingya refugees to children devastated by Huricane Harvey down in your region of the US
	Persuadee: Ah yes I believe I have heard of that organization before. I really appreciate what all of those people do to help others in trouble, its a very noble cause. 
Persuader: Yes. And they try to cover all their bases with programs not just for relief, but also education, protection, and health promotion.
	Persuadee: That's amazing! I didn't know they branched out into other things like education!
Persuader: Yes. Everything from research to direct support of schools and children at all levels.  Would you be interested in hearing how you personally could help Save the Children and make a big difference!
	Persuadee: yes, I would love to know how I can help!
Persuader: Well, as with anything all of these programs cost money to run. So the organization is always looking for donations.  The great thing is that even very small amounts can do amazing things!

628,"Persuader: Hello there
	Persuadee: How's it going today?
Persuader: Great. Have you heard about Save the children charity
	Persuadee: No, I have never heard of it, I don't think. Maybe I have and just didn't know it. But can you fill me in on what they do?
Persuader: Ofcourse. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: Alright, I see. Can you tell me anything else about them? Anything more specific?
Persuader: I also knew a couple of kids. Oh my god! It is just sad because they died from hunger. So if people make donations. It will be very helpful to avoid situations like that
	Persuadee: That makes sense. Child suffering is one of the harder tragedies that we'd all probably like to avoid if we could.
Persuader: exactly. I support the organization because I know how good and professional they are. Peoples donations will go to a trustable fund
	Persuadee: That's an interesting point you make. Most people's problems with charities is they can never understand how the money is used, if it's used efficiently, how they're trustworthy, etc. It's hard enough to have money to donate, so people want to make sure that, if they do, it's actually making a difference.
Persuader: Right. I feel the same way. I have made donations in the past and I know for a fact that it went to waste. But this organization is just different.
	Persuadee: Can you tell me specifically how they're different? Do you know?
Persuader: Like I said they use the donations and these go straight to those in need. 
	Persuadee: I suppose. I always try to get as information I possibly can so that I can feel as confident about my decision as possible. I don't have a lot of money, so if I were to donate it, I'd need to make sure it went to those that needed it more than I do, and not only have like maybe a small amount actually go to the cause, while the other amount just ends up going into the pockets of CEOs and what-not.
Persuader: Understandable! Here is the website you can visit to gather more information and you will be pleased.  URL  ... Remember we all can be part of the solution. Would you like to make a donation to Save the Childrens /
	Persuadee: I think I'd need more time to think about it, and to read through the website, maybe do some internet searches. Like I said, I'm a struggling college student, and most of my money has to go towards rent, food, and school supplies, etc. Thank you for the suggestion, though.
Persuader: No problem. Hopefully you can donate in the future *Small donations mean Big donations* to them also. I wish you the best in your college life :)  
	Persuadee: Thank you! I really appreciate that sentiment. And I wish you the same in anything you're doing right now. I like your saying. I will take it to heart and give it serious consideration.

630,"Persuader: Good morning. I am looking to raise money for the charity Save the Children and I was wondering if you might beinterested?
	Persuadee: I have been reading articles about Save the Children charity and I find them quite interesting.
Persuader: They are a really good charity. For instance, they have been helping families trapped in the Syrian conflict. Did you realize that 1000 children with killed or injured the first 2 months of this year in Syria? Anything you can donate will go help a family avoid these situations.
	Persuadee: I think this is quite interesting. I have read that 86% of the funds raised go directly to benefiting the children. I also think it is very interesting that a woman is President & CEO. I think this is great because not to often are woman CEO's. This speaks volumes in my opinion to the donors.
Persuader: You are correct. The charity has low administrative overhead, meaning most of the money goes to helping children in dire situations. It is also important that a woman heads a major charity likes this. She can bring a different perspective to the charity that might not be seen in another chairty. I can tell you already know a lot about this charity and the good work they are doing!
	Persuadee: I feel a know a good bit about charities. I am disappointed in the salaries of the CEO, Executive VP & VP. I think a half million dollars that the CEO is compensated is a bit much. These dollars could be used to help more children. 
Persuader: You won't hear me argue with that, but the fact is to attract qualified people to run a major charity is a costly endeavor. For example, the head of the Human Rights Campaign makes $600,000 a year and I think we can agree this charity has a much wider scope. It is unfortunate that these salaries have to be paid and not go to the children, but we also need people running the charity who can actually make an impact on saving the children.
	Persuadee: I agree that a qualified person is needed to run such a charity. I think my biggest concern when salaries get so high they lose focus of what the organization is needing to do. We all like money! I think that this organization is a very good organization and have competent people running it. There are so many children charities that you really have to study each one to be able to decide who you would want to make your donation to. Are you a donor of Save the Children charity?
Persuader: Yes and I also donate to UNICEF. What I like about both programs are the educational outreach they do. Most of these children would never have a chance to get an education and Save the Children serves millions of children in this area. Not only does the child get an education they would otherwise not get, they also get basic healthcare and nutrition thrown in as well. The dollar you spend truly does go a long way to helping others! 
	Persuadee: Absolutely true of Save the Children. I always look at how many children have been helped and what they help the children with. I then look at the overall salaries of the organization (petty maybe) but I need to make sure in my heart that the money I donate is going to help children not the management, even though I know a portion goes to them. I am willing to make a donation to the great cause.
Persuader: If it helps you, Charity Navigator gives them 3 out of 4 stars. As you probably know there are very few charities that have a 4 star rating. This is mainly due to overhead costs of the charities. That being said, you can be assured your money will be doing a lot of good in the world!
	Persuadee: Absolutely. I use Charity Navigator when I decide to make donations. I think it is important for people to look at this when making a decision to donate to any organization.
Persuader: I think that is very wise to do. Even if you are making a small donation, you want to be sure that it is being used to its fullest potential.
	Persuadee: Yes. I think this is where some people are lacking in making donations to organizations who don't benefit the greater good. Knowledge is a key factor.
Persuader: It is a shame that we live in a world where this is an issue, but I think if you make a donation to Save the Children, you can be assured your money will be used to the fullest extent.
	Persuadee: I agree. I will be making a donation to Save the Children organization.
Persuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.
	Persuadee: I would absolutely donate the whole amount from this survey. I feel confident that the money would be well spent.

	Persuadee: Yes hello, how are you?
Persuader: I am doing really, really well today. It's so encouraging to be a part of something bigger than myself, ya know?
	Persuadee: To what larger thing are you referring?
Persuader: Well, I\'ve recently become aware of this organization called ""Save the Children"" that provide relief effort to children in developing countries and I\'ve taken it upon myself to use my own resources to see that they get the support they need. It feels so good to do be doing good.
	Persuadee: Oh, I see. What sort of work does Save the Children do?
Persuader: well, they promote children's rights in countries that perhaps still have some work to do in that regard. Clothing the naked, feeding the hungry. That sort of thing. Would you be at all interested in experiencing this thing too?
	Persuadee: How do you mean, experiencing this thing too?
Persuader: Experiencing the intangible and invaluable reward of helping someone less fortunate than ourselves.
	Persuadee: Oh, I see. I am already involved in a child related charity, to which I provide my charitable contributions.
Persuader: That's wonderful! I see that you have a good heart and that is so encouraging to me. I'm sure that charity truly appreciates you too. But those problems really have a way sticking around for longer than we would like, don't they? Who knows when the next hurricane, tsunami, drought, or otherwise unavoidable tragedy will take it's toll on an unsuspecting child in need?
	Persuadee: Well, no one, as disasters are necessarily unpredictable.
Persuader: Exactly! Which is why I propose you donate a portion or all of your reward for this task to the Save the Children organization. It costed you a few minutes, but think about it grants the children! One extra meal, or one clean shirt. Hard to put a cost on another human being's comfort...ESPECIALLY a child. Do you think you could do this for them?
	Persuadee: Oh. No thank you, as I indicated in my previous response, I already have a charitable organization to which I provide money. Thank you for the time though.
Persuader: Well, I really think you should reconsider. If not for them, than for you! I think I perhaps may be inclined to let the timer run on these responses if we can't come to an agreement. Now, how much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.
	Persuadee: I will stay with my previous response, I will donate $0.
Persuader: Well, I see now that I have some work to do in my efforts to save these poor unfortunate souls. If only I could learn to truly highlight the atrocities these suffering youths experience every hour. For instance, In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. How tragic! Please, I beg of you, aid me in my endeavor and strengthen my will to continue fighting the good fight. 
	Persuadee: I appreciate your position, but as I already have a charitable organization to which I contribute money, I'm afraid I'll have to stay firm with my response; there is no persuasive technique you could use which will change my mind on this issue.
Persuader: What's a little more, thoughtful stranger? Do you not feel the stirring in your soul? Have you become so enamored by the shine of gold and silver that you have deafened your ear to the call of this growing need? Rise up! The time is now to respond, when the sky is darkest. Be the sun the warms the hearts and bodies of the ever burdened!

632,"Persuader: Save the Children is a great organization that looks out for the well being of children in need.  Currently they are looking for individuals to help their cause.
	Persuadee: where is this organization based? Do they help children from a particular country or is it all around the world? 
Persuader: They help children mostly in developing countries around the world.  Think about all the stories you hear in the news and on social media about children that need help or have been taken advantage of.
	Persuadee: Yeah stories like that are very heart breaking. What types of programs do they offer? Like do they just supply food?
Persuader: They often protect children from being victims of hunger, violence, and child labor.  They also advocate for schooling and provide opportunities for families to get ahead.  It is a great social cause that is worth donating to!
	Persuadee: That sound great but you know my biggest concern with making donations to charities is always the question of just how much of the money I give actually reaches to the intended people.
Persuader: Save the Children is a very well known, credible organization with transparency.  Visiting the organization's website allows you to understand how even a small donation can have an impact.
	Persuadee: Oh I see so they have a website that I could learn more about them. 
Persuader: Think about how much money you spend on non essentials in your life.  Now think about sacrificing just one of those to help out a child.
	Persuadee: Yeah I think its good to help any little bit you can. How much is the typical donation amount usually?
Persuader: It all depends on what you are comfortable with.  Every bit helps.  But one thing is for certain, you will feel good about your donation!
	Persuadee: So after making a donation, I won't exactly see how the money I give will be used right? I mean this is not like sponsoring a child or family situation right?
Persuader: You will not see how it directly impacts one child, but instead think about focusing on how your donation would impact multiple children and families!
	Persuadee: Yes that is true. Have you made a donation to this organization before?
Persuader: I try to donate a couple of times per year, especially around the holidays.  I have felt great in the past about this and will continue in the future.  You will instantly feel better about your decision once you do.

	Persuadee: Ok, yes, that is very important. 
Persuader: It truly is. Our children need to be taken care of, and due to lack of resources in third world countries, children are suffering. It is disheartening to see and hear about. 
	Persuadee: Yes, it is very hard to look at pictures of children in raggety clothes and they look so thin.
Persuader: I agree. Sadly, the world as a whole don't view this as a global problem. Not to be cliche, but children are our future, and it's our moral obligation to make sure they are taken care of and given the proper resources to prosper and thrive in this world. Do you agree?

Persuader: I understand. Having a visual of what's being done is very important. However, we have children that are suffering, and even just a penny can make a difference in their lives. Are you sure you couldn't spare one penny? Our website is  URL if you wanted to gather more information
	Persuadee: Not at this time. I am maxed out with giving at this point. If I get a raise at my job then I'd think about it.
Persuader: I understand that financial restraints can deter us from giving, but these children are dependent on us. They need not only our love, but support. One penny won't break the bank, and you'll know that that one cent, so minute to us, is so rich to them as it provide basic necessities for them to live.

Persuader: Yes I just saw that, sorry. So I think we should both donate if given the option. Children are our future, and there are way too many out there that will never have a chance at a future because they're starving right now, or in unsafe environments. The impact of any money given will be much greater for the kids, than if we were to keep it ourselves.

	Persuadee: No I have not. Can you tell me more about this organization?
Persuader: Yeah absolutely! It's not a government organization, so in my opinion the funds are better spent than being wasted in the typical bureaucratic red tape and wasteful expenditures. This means that it's reliant on donations from the public though! They also provide relief for extremely vulnerable children. In addition to money and food relief that they provide, they also offer access to health and education that they otherwise would not. 
	Persuadee: I see. What is your role with this charity?
Persuader: Oh none, just a supporter. I'm a single mother, so any Good organizations hit close to home. Do you think this sounds like an organization you'd support?
	Persuadee: Oh I see. If I were to donate, how would I pay?
Persuader: Well actually you could donate without actually having to pay! Mturk is giving us a bonus, and we can choose to donate part of it right through Mturk! I think this is awesome, because too many organizations just care about getting the results that they're looking for (research). But at least this one is also doing some social good as well! Do you think you'd donate just $1 if it was given through Mturk like I mentioned?
	Persuadee: That's really awesome! Yeah $1 sounds good to me but I don't know if this amount would be impactful as you mentioned a few conversations ago.
Persuader: That's not true, every penny counts! And in other countries, money can go a lot farther. Just because of your $1, there's now a child that won't have to go without food today or tomorrow :) You should feel good about your contribution!
	Persuadee: You're right! I guess I need to start donating more often too. And yes, I'll donate my $1.
Persuader: Thank you! I can relate though, I often feel like I'm not doing enough. But that's because there's always more that can be done! But as long as we help when we can, and stay aware of more opportunities to help, them we're doing our part at least!

Persuader: No i do not have any kids, but I have a soft heart for kids. I like how ""Save the Children"" works on health and educational issues in 120 countries.
	Persuadee: There is a good time and place for vaccines. Save the Children do help with vaccines as well as food. Crazy how 30.00 a month can change a child's future.  Another charity I read about is Reach Out and Read, they supply used books to doctors offices to help kids read by educating the nurses on talking to parents about the importance of reading. I never heard of them before today, have you?
Persuader: No I haven't heard. It is so good that you know a lot about children's charity. a little help can make a big difference, sometimes a family can live with just $30.00 per month
	Persuadee: Internet research is a good way to learn about pretty much anything. It's hard to come up with a bunch of conversation about charity. It's easy to just live in your own world and not think about the horrible things in the world. Charity is a good way to get a collective group of people to make a change in the world. There are so many childrens charities like KABOOM, they build updated playgrounds for kids with disabilities. 
Persuader: You have a lot of knowledge, thanks for sharing. I like the organization that are transparent with their financial reports, specially the ones that collaborate with big companies.
	Persuadee: Yea, I think thats most important. There are so many so called charities that keep almost all of the donated funds and only a few pennies of each dollar actually go towards the need. I read a blog about Sea World is a big donater to children's charities. Make a Wish Foundation is a good one, have you heard of them?
Persuader: No not really, I know a little about different charities. I just donate here and there. I will save the ones you mentioned and will definitely search about them. I like how these HITs give the opportunity to talk about charities
	Persuadee: Ive had a few of the charity HITs. I like to learn about an array of different things. I've actually been intrigued by alot of the things I've head on the HITs. Save the children was one of the charities talked about on here. I have a cousin who works with MercyShip. They are an organization that sales to african countries and does hundreds of thousands of surgeries on children in need.
Persuader: That is awesome. I have donated to organization that works on some disease through MTurk, like Malaria 
	Persuadee: I'm grasping at straws now, 10 turns each is a monumental task just like fighting childhood cancer (not really) have you ever donated to charities for childhood cancer?
Persuader: yes I did it before. Actually it breaks my heart to see children in pain. I think It is good to know donating through this task won't hurt your reward
	Persuadee: Childrens charities are important to increase awareness for diseases and disabilities. I cant even imagine what these poor families go through. McDonalds does a charity that helps house families near hospitals so they can be together during a hospital stay. Ronald McDonald House is the name I think. 
Persuader: I will look for it for sure. I like it when part of my purchase will be donated. Thank you for all the information
	Persuadee: It's been a pleasure chatting with you about children charities. I think this is the last chat exchange. Have a good day!
