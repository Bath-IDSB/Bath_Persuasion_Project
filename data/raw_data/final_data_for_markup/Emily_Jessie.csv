168,"Persuader: Hello, do you give to charities on a regular basis?
	Persuadee: Hello, I donate here and there but not on a regular basis
Persuader: I understand! It is nice that you do give to charities because every little bit helps. Have you heard of the organization Save the Children?
	Persuadee: Yes . I've heard about it but I would like to have more information
Persuader: Sure, they are an international organization not connected to any government that promotes children's rights and provides relief and support to children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: Interesting, in how many countries do they work?
Persuader: Right now they are in 120 countries and have helped 33.3 million children directly. I am partial to children's charities because they help the ones who can't really help themselves.
	Persuadee: So nice, what are the main issues they work on? 
Persuader: They provide better healthcare and education for children as well as providing emergency aid when natural disasters occur or war and other conflicts. Did you know in Jan and Feb alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in Syria due to violence in that country?
	Persuadee: I've heard about it. It breaks my heart. is this organization clear with its financial reports?
Persuader: Yes in fact the most recent rating of Save the Children by a non profit charity watchdog gave it an ""A"". I think that is pretty clear.
	Persuadee: That is so good to find a trustworthy charities. I think there should be a few well-known companies cooperating with this charity
Persuader: I agree. I think more people need to get on board to help the children. If we all do a little by sacrificing that 1 coffee a week or by eating out one time less per week, we could all make more of a difference, right?
	Persuadee: right, every little help make a big difference. we can support a family with few dollars in some countries
Persuader: That is true for sure. I'm going to give some of my earnings today to STC, would you be willing to give some also if only $.25?
	Persuadee: I guess I will donate even more. I will donate today but can i please have their website in case i want to donate later?
Persuader: Sure, it is  URL but just know that if you donate through here the research team collects the donations and sends it all to STC so it is above board.
	Persuadee: Thank you for the information. Yes I will do it. I am glad there is a chance to help through HITs
Persuader: Yes definitely. It has been nice chatting with you. You seem like a very kind person. Have a great day and thanks for your help with STC!

Persuader: im great! how are you
	Persuadee: doing well, i'm not really sure what the task at hand is though!
Persuader: me neither, still reading it
	Persuadee: I don't think I missed any instructions but what I've noticed is that I'm supposed to start a conversation about a children's charity and there is supposed to be a donation agreement...
Persuader: yeah thats what i read too
	Persuadee: Are you also in the ""communicator role""
Persuader: a persuader. no idea if i can tell you that? it doesnt say not to
	Persuadee: Well given the limited instructions after the survey, at least we're trying to honestly figure out how to complete this task. That's how I see it anyways.
Persuader: i'm supposed to get you to donate to the charity
	Persuadee: Do you know what charity?
Persuader: save the children
	Persuadee: Okay, I don't know if I'm just supposed to donate theoretical dollars or what? I mean why wouldn't I donate to save the children? ha idk this is pretty damn vague
Persuader: yeah, it doesnt really say. and i dont see how we are supposed to finish and submit the hit??
	Persuadee: It's telling us not to game the task but I kinda think we're getting gamed
Persuader: yeah im confused.
	Persuadee: well i know we need to communicate 10 times and this would be number 9 so hopefully something will pop up after one more message each, how much should I ""donate\'?
Persuader: i think any amount you want? like a buck or something is usual for hits on mturk
	Persuadee: I was thinking I'd donate 1 million theoretical dollars, but lets just say 1 dollar to be safe, fingers crossed we can submit after this

170,"Persuader: Hello how are you today?
	Persuadee: I'm good. How are you?
Persuader: I am doing great! I am here to let you know about this amazing international foundation called Save the Children that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support them in developing countries.
	Persuadee: Please tell me more.
Persuader:  These children are being used in horrific ways, the food and supplies that are supposed to be going to them are being stolen and we are trying to gather money to ensure the supplies get to these children who really need these supplies and help. With a donation today, not only will we be able to ensure the supply lines safely reach villages, but doctors will also go and help the children with medical care they desperately need. All I ask is that you donate a portion of your task payment to this charity to help the children.
	Persuadee: How do I know this charity is legit?
Persuader: You are free to look up any information you like at  URL 
	Persuadee: How much of the donations goto the children and the effort?
Persuader: 100% of your donation will go directly to Save the Children. Just think of it this way, instead of getting your morning coffee, or that bag of chips at lunch, you could donate $2 today and help ensure that 3 children get the care they need and food in their stomachs.
	Persuadee: Does 100% go to the effort directly or does any of the monies go to employees like the director of the charity ect?
Persuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it all directly to Save the children. So it will go to pay for the flights to get the team over there, medicine, food, everything needed to help these children
	Persuadee: What roughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?
Persuader: Like I said earlier, 100% of your donation goes directly to helping these children. Look, already in 2018 alone, 1,000 children have been reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. They need your help. They need your donation more than you do honestly. What is $2 to you when that money can literally save lives over there?
	Persuadee: There are many scams out there that take more to profit then to actually help the kids. I need to know these things before I donate even if it is as little as $2.
Persuader: You can go to the website I provided you earlier to know in your heart that this is not a scam. Can I count on you to help these children? Are you willing to trust me enough to donate your task payment to help these children?
	Persuadee: I do not know in my heart that this is not a scam. I have been scammed before. That is why i am asking you for the details. Againwhat  roughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?
Persuader:  I went to the website and looked up the actual numbers. 86.5% of donations goes directly to the villages and the rest goes to fund the outreach, website, and publicity. it is a non-profit organization. You don't have to donate the entire amount of your task payment. you can choose any amount from nothing to the $2. I am just hoping you would be gracious to help these children enough to give the $2 and give them a fighting chance. I really believe you know this isn't a scam
	Persuadee: How do you donate?
Persuader: This chat is being recorded, you Tell me how much you would like to donate and I will give it to the research team for them to deduct it from your task payment and send it to Save the Children. How much would you like to donate today?

Persuader: That's great to hear! Have you heard of the charity, Save The Children before? 
	Persuadee: YES ,I KNOW THE CHARITY OF THE SAVE THE CHILDREN.
Persuader: It's a great  charity. It provides relief to children in bad situations. It provides education, health and safety. But currently it hasn't been receiving many donations. It's a little concerning
	Persuadee: OH, I DONATE A MONEY FOR THEM.
Persuader: Unfortunately they are in need of their current donators to donate a little more often or else they will lose out on opportunities to achieve their goals in saving children in Syria. It would be great if you could donate today. It would help out displaced children facing troubles in Syria. 
	Persuadee: OH, I AM SO SAD ABOUT THAT NEWS.
Persuader: You can choose any amount of your donation and will be directly deducted from this task payment. Even 1 cent goes a long way to help providing help for children in need. One cent can buy a pound of grain which could last for weeks for a small family.
	Persuadee: OK, I GIVE 10 CENT TO THEM.
Persuader: Thank you. This donation of 10 cents will  be collected by the research team and sent directly to Save The Children. You will also be a part of a wall of honour, honouring those who donated their time. How does it make you feel to help out Save The Children?

Persuader: Do you want to know of anymore information concerning what we do? 
	Persuadee: YES, TELL ME THE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GIVE TO THE CHILDREN.
Persuader: From your donation, 10 cents will be given to the children, which is incredible. This can buy several families food that can last for weeks. It will also be used to provide materials for school.

Persuader: Ha.  I guess I don't blame you.  But here in Chicago it means grey skies and cold weather coming soon.  Are you a fan of cold weather?
	Persuadee: No, I like it for to be around 70-75 degrees.  I just like a good moderate temperature. Texans aren't built for the cold.
Persuader: Lol.  Yeah that sounds good to me too.  One thing about Texans though. I feel as if you guys are generous people.  Would you agree to that statement?
	Persuadee: For the most part, it's true. We are community oriented.
Persuader: Right on.   I think that's an honorable trait to have.  Let me ask you something. Are you somebody who likes to give to charities?
	Persuadee: At times, I do. It depends on the cause.
Persuader: Yeah. I'm the saw way.  I tend to pick charities from the top of the ranking websites.  For example, I'm a really big fan of Save the Children.  Have you heard of them?
	Persuadee: Yes, but I am not sure what they do exactly.
Persuader: Save the Children is a charity commited to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.  They are active in many conflict zones and during tragedies.  They are a very reputable organization.  
	Persuadee: Do they ever do work within the United States?
Persuader: As a matter of fact they do.  Here is a link to their work in the US:  URL s/what-we-do/us-programs
	Persuadee: Wow, that's great to know. I learned something new.
Persuader: Yeah.  And now that you've read about them, you might be interested to know that we can donate to them directly through this HIT.  Save the Children recognizes that even small amounts of money add up and have a huge impact on their work
	Persuadee: Okay, that sounds like a novel idea.
Persuader: Would you like to join me in donating to them today?  You can choose from any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).  How much would you like to donate to the charity now?

	Persuadee: I donate to children charity right here in the United States already
Persuader: Well this one has US-specific programs you can donate to.
	Persuadee: How much of what I donate goes to the children?
Persuader: About 86.5%, the rest goes to staff and other infastructure.
	Persuadee: That's not a bad percentage considering, but isn't non-profit supposed to be volunteers?
Persuader: No, non-profits can have paid employees, and many charities when they reach a certain size need them to organize things.  Just that in non-profits, the compensation must be reasonable, and you can have passive investors that get paid who don't engage in any employment activities at the company.
	Persuadee: That's interesting to learn. What is the funding for the children used for primarily? Housing, food, or schooling?
Persuader: Yes, housing, food and schooling are definite priorities.  Save the Children also provides assistance to children that go through natural disasters or conflicts, along with protection from abuse, and access to healthcare.
	Persuadee: I like that! People don't usually think about protection from abuse and natural disaster relief. 
Persuader: Yeah, they don't, and the US has had some natural disasters in the past few years.  Houston, TX being one last year. 
	Persuadee: That's true and it seems like we're only going to continue seeing more need for a children's charity such as this world wide.
Persuader: Hopefully that doesn't happen.  However, would you be willing to donate, even if it's just a small amount?
	Persuadee: I'll donate $2 for the children and feel like it's in safe hands of people willing and able to help them.

	Persuadee: support children in more development country
Persuader: yes, because really we have a lot of support in the US but so many countries just do not have the infrastructure or governmental or non governmental structure to help in any real way. Save the children goes in and provides food and other relief
	Persuadee: food also the main problem of the more countries 
Persuader: I am not sure if you are aware but the research team for this task will collect any donations we make from the payment of the task  and send it to Save the Children

Persuader: Children in developing countries, especially in war zones. Syria, Gaza Strip, Eastern Ukraine.. 
	Persuadee: Does Save the Children help children in other areas of the world? I know there are a lot of children suffering all over the world, even in first world countries like the United States where there is still drug abuse and sex trafficking.

	Persuadee: How does Save the Children provide assistance? i.e do they send out volunteers? or nurses or trained staff to provide the assistance? are they people that live locally in the surrounding area?
Persuader: Save the Children provided assistance in many ways. If a child is in an area of war and can't go to school, Save the Children will help relocate the child to safer school. If a child is in a danger zone with no food, Save the Children establishes emergency malnutrition units in the hardest hit areas. It is a very large effort for lots of people.
	Persuadee: How does someone who wants to have a part in Save the Children join?
Persuader: A donation is the easiest way to make a large impact. Our independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. We keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.
	Persuadee: It was very nice talking with you. I did not even know Save the Children existed. I'm glad there are people in the world who have the kindness in their hearts to make an impact on the world's littlest population.

	Persuadee: Hey, how are you doing today?
Persuader: Not terrible. SO, in order to complete this task, I am supposed to convince you to donate part of your award to Save The Children.
	Persuadee: Alright, tell me about that then.
Persuader: Pretty basic. You can decide between 0-2 dollars to donate. I mean, Save the Children is a well known charity with a really high score for using their donations for actual charitable work
	Persuadee: Well I've never been much of a charity person and don't know anything about Charities other than more than a few aren't very truthful about what they do.
Persuader: Believe me, I understand on that one. Save the Children is really transparent about how they spend their money. Not to mention you can look at several different sites online that rank how truthful charitable organizations are. I have to use these a lot. I am a disabled veteran, and there are a lot of socalled veteran groups out there. 
	Persuadee: Even then what's really to convince me to make a donation in the first place? I'm not exactly in a great situation myself.
Persuader: It is your choice, either way. Basically 2 bucks might make a difference to you, but makes a huge difference to a hurting child in another country. I am not going to bug you, if you can't afford it, I respect that.
	Persuadee: Well, your goal is to convince me.
Persuader: True. Pretty much, breaks down like this. Your donation, of any amount, will help children around the world live better lives. The charity is well respected. The amount is small. 
	Persuadee: Have you donated to the charity before? Yes, the amount may seem small but I'm in need of it too.
Persuader: Yes, I have. As a matter of fact, I donated a hundred bucks two weeks ago.
	Persuadee: And if you, as well as other people are able to do that does the $2 from me really matter that much? Not to mention you probably didn't have to skip a meal to make that donation either.
Persuader: That is fair. So, if you cannot afford it, choose to donate 0. Charity is a very personal decision.
	Persuadee: So you have no other means to try and convince me with?
Persuader: If I cannot convince you by either checking out the charity yourself, or thinking about making a difference in the lives of poverty stricken children around the world, you probably would not donate no matter how much money you had.
	Persuadee: So you believe I am just a selfish person with no desire to help others regardless of how well or poorly I am personally doing?
Persuader: I did not mean to insult you personally. I am simply saying that I can give you the facts of what the charity is, and what my purpose is for convincing you. If you cannot afford it, I am not making any value judgments based on that. So, how much do you want to donate, 0-2?
	Persuadee: I'll just go with a 50/50 split and donate $1. everyone deserves a chance at life.

	Persuadee: Yes I did. I did spent it on the beach while doing some barbecue with my friends. It was lot of fun the past couple of days. How was your weekend?
Persuader: It was relaxing. Sometimes we plan busy weekends but this weekend we stayed home and relaxed. I've actually been reading about Save the Children. Are you familiar with the organization?
	Persuadee: Yes I am. It is a very great organization and I believe it was founded by two former presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The organization is charity for the children who have been displaced by either hurricanes or other natural disasters and the charity steps in to help those children and families in need. 
Persuader: Yes. I've always thought it was a worthwhile organization. I think we are all responsible in some way for taking care of the children of the world in whatever way we can.
	Persuadee: That is very true because the way that I see it we are all one big family and should be there for one another in a time of crisis and distress.
Persuader: Yes! I couldn't agree more. We are all in this together. Who knows what we can accomplish if we all do what we can for one another. 
	Persuadee: Yes. We can accomplish big things if we care for one another and it shouldn't matter what party we are in whether its Democrat, Republican or Green it shouldn't matter. We are all Americans and we are one family. 
Persuader: Once again, I couldn't agree more. I was just reading Save the Children is working in Syria. I'm sad to say, they are reporting over 1000 children have died in 2018 in the war. It's horrific to think of children having to live with this sort of fear. 
	Persuadee: That is both terrible and sad to hear. Syria has a dictatorship and and someone who is obsessed with power. This is a bad combination because a lot of people and especially the most vulnerable like children are getting caught in the crossfire. Its very sad.
Persuader: It is sad. I'm thinking about sending them a donation. I don't have much of a budget but I suppose every little be helps. If the millions of people just in the US alone contributed $1, that would be quite an infusion of money for Save the Children. 
	Persuadee: That is correct. If people in the US contribute $1 for Save the Children the world will be indeed a better place. I will do also give a donation. Children must never live in fear and in horrible conditions that they can't escape from.
Persuader: According the researchers who's MTurk HIT I'm working on, you could donate right now through this HIT. Your donation could be deducted from your HIT payment. Would you like to commit to donating up to $2 right now?
	Persuadee: Yes I willing to commit half of my payment from this Hit. I think it would help many children.
Persuader: Wonderful! So I can tell them you'll donate $1? They say they will deduct the donations and submit them to Save the Children. 
	Persuadee: Fantastic.That will be great. I think many lives will be saved if we all contribute to this organization.
Persuader: I agree! I'll also be making a donation. It was very nice to talk with you!

Persuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: Okay interesting. How do I know I can trust the charity will do the promised thing with my donation?
Persuader: You just have to trust me. Your donation will go towards helping the fight for children's rights to health, education, safety and so on. I'm asking you to donate your entire task payment to this foundation.
	Persuadee: What countries would my donation be helping?
Persuader: Many different countries, especially war zones... One that hits close to home for me is Syria. Millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Your small donation could help at least one of these children live a life without fear.
	Persuadee: Okay I am interested but I wouldn't want to donate my entire task payment. Can I donate another amount?
Persuader: The whole task amount isn't much to us but would be so much to them but I understand. How much of it would you be willing to donate?
	Persuadee: 0.15 half of my payment. I have a family to provide for and any little bit helps. But I also would like to help others.
Persuader: Wow that's awesome. I totally understand about having to support a family too. I love the idea of helping others also, any little way that I can.
	Persuadee: Is there anything else I should know about the charity?
Persuader: Something I found pretty cool is Save The Children actually helped children fully recover in Texas after Hurricane Harvey. I like the idea that they are worldwide.
	Persuadee: Wow they really have a far reach. That is wonderful what they are doing for our world.
Persuader: Yes it is. They are a huge advocate to children. They believe that children make up 20% of our population but are 100% of our future and I couldn't agree more.
	Persuadee: Children truly are our future. We need to care for them as we will need them in our old age.
Persuader: Yes, your donation will go to help one of millions of children. If you would like to be a sponsor for about a dollar a day you can go to  URL and sign up.In 2015, 183,000 sponsors like you supported programs that directly benefited more than 2.8 million children in 23 countries around the world _ including the United States. Thanks to our growing community of child sponsors, we increased our impact and reach _ helping 29% more children than we did in 2014 
	Persuadee: Wow that is a lot of sponsors. Are you a sponsor?
Persuader: Honestly, I am not. But after doing this task and reading up on the website I am going to sign up. I love to do charity work. I also do alot of local volunteer work. Any way I can help a defenseless child I will. I always place my own child in their shoes. That's motivation enough... to picture my babies going through what these kids go through.

	Persuadee: I do have some time to answer questions.
Persuader: Do you consider yourself to be a charitable person? What type of charities do you donate to?
	Persuadee: I do consider myself to be a charitable person. I do not currently donate money because I do not have an income at the moment, however, when I have a bit of extra money, I like to give to St Jude's Children's hospital. I also like to buy food or drinks for homeless people when I see them and have some extra money to do so. 
Persuader: That is generous of you! I understand about only donating if you have a means to. In that case I usually am more willing to volunteer my time. Have you heard of the organization Save the Children?
	Persuadee: I have not heard of that organization before. What is it?
Persuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: Oh that's really cool. Can you tell me what kind of children's rights you mean?
Persuader: Here is a short article about Save the Children's work with children's rights in Armenia:  URL s/what-we-do/where-we-work/greater-middle-east-eurasia/armenia
	Persuadee: I understand now. Is this an organization that you like to donate time and money to? 
Persuader: I'm like you, if I have the means I definitely would. I usually can't donate much, just a dollar or so, but everything helps and anything is better than nothing.
	Persuadee: Yeah I definitely understand that. Right now all the money I have is going into savings for my own little person who's on the way. 
Persuader: Oh congratulations! I don't have any children, but all my extra money has been going towards student loan debt. Do you think that you could do $0.25?
	Persuadee: I really wish that I could, but between my own student loans and the credit debt that I have had to incur while going to appointments and such while unemployed, I really need every last cent to get myself financially stable.
Persuader: I understand. I don't want to be pushy. Is there anything else you would like to know about the organization Save the Children so you could make an informed decision to donate in the future when you are in a better situation to donate?
	Persuadee: So I looked at things like the US children coming across the boarder, but do they do things like bringing food and medical equipment to children in other countries?
Persuader: Yes, they do a lot of emergency response work. No one knows when the next earthquake, flood or tsunami will strike. But we do know children are severely affected by natural disasters. They also suffer greatly during conflict, drought and disease outbreaks. Save the Children's natural disaster response and emergency relief programs help protect vulnerable boys and girls during disasters and their aftermath.
	Persuadee: Oh that's really cool. I love learning new things about the medical field so it is always nice to learn about someone that brings things like basic medial equipment to places that need them.

Persuader: I am supposed to ask you if you care about people being killed in Syria and things like that, I don't want to cause you any emotional discomfort by talking about suffering people. Is that okay?  To talk about suffering people and children for a minute?
	Persuadee: I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.
Persuader: I think the refugee crisis is crazy, I am not sure what I would do if I was raising my kids in Syria.  If anyone could have fun in those spots it's kids though.  
	Persuadee: I feel really torn about the crisis.  I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.  At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.
Persuader: I actually didn't think of it like that.  I am a parent too, it feels so foreign what they are going through.  This whole chat thing is supposed to get me to get you to donate to Save the Children, but now I think they got me to do it instead! I don't know if that's really okay to do though. 
	Persuadee: I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked. I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call ""stupid"".  I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.  Sorry Im getting off topic.
Persuader: No, that's relevant. Really relevant. It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.  I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.  If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.  The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.  You're not a horrible person it sounds like, just worried if what you do even matters.  
	Persuadee: With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.  My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.  SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.  I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!
Persuader: I feel like you are smart enough and definitely moral enough to be the boss.  I hope you have success  in your field. I don't have that great of a job or boss but I'd still  I would like to match a donation with you if you're willing to try help kids with me.  I am parent and I feel like I need extra help sometimes too , but knowing that I could REALLY help them makes feel like a better parent.
	Persuadee: I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.  They are the weak ones in my eyes.
Persuader: I don't want you to donate any more than you want, so if you want to donate how much do you to do? I think any amount you give (especially more) will definitely help and I want you to know that it would be deducted from you task payment. Whatever you choose to do or the amount you want to give, I feel like you've changed my mind about charity, not the other way around, so I want to thank you for that.
	Persuadee: I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.  I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.
Persuader: If you're doing this task then you might be able to afford it, but if you can I'd probably say you should really donate it all just this one time.  So whatever you donate I can donate as well, and can actually help each other donate to the kids.  You want to match all our payment to Save the Children? Would that be okay? Or should we lock in your half payment?
	Persuadee: I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.  I would lock into half.
Persuader: Sure let's do it. I might donate a little more I don't know how to do that but, I think they deserve it, I'm convince by talking to you that people regardless of how they feel about refugees that they can still care about kids. 
	Persuadee: I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!
Persuader: Oh, I didn't think of it like that either.  I always picture like you said about your boss, one kid.  But you're right it's a whole generation, that's A LOT of people.  I always forget that kids turn into adults, i mean not that part, but the whole part where they are all apart of the community! :)

Vulnerable children in poverty. Denied an education. Forced to flee violence. Orphaned, abused, abandoned. Children with no reason to smile. No hope for the future.

Persuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children, been a one of the most well seen after charities, it is safe to assume the donation will be used for good.
	Persuadee: I'm not convinced. What percentage of a donation do you think would reach an actual victim?
Persuader: All the donation would reach the destination, the donation amount comes from the task payment, The end goal of this surely should be to support the needs of the growing demand for children. a small donation to them can go along way as shown by what save the children can do each year. 
	Persuadee: If you say so. I'm still hesitant. 
Persuader: You do not need to be, its shown the impact save the children have globally via donations, i ensure you it will help make a difference. i understand the hesitation but it would e very helpful to donate to the charity? does this appeal to you
	Persuadee: The way you're phrasing it it doesn't appeal to me at all, sorry. 
Persuader: i do apologize, it would not have to be a large sum donation any percentage of the final payment would make a difference, would not even something as low as 25 % be of interest ? the basis of 1000s of children depend of donations like this.
	Persuadee: Ok fine. So how much do you propose the donation should be?
Persuader: the donation comes from the task payment, the percentage is decided on how generous you feel and how much of an impact you want to make, ideally of course i would want all the task payment to go to charity, but anything can help.
	Persuadee: In all honesty I'd rather donate to an animal shelter so let's meet halfway.
Persuader: i see, well any charity donation from my view is of great need, although i feel save the children are in more need than an animal shelter in terms of the money they need to make an impact. would a 50/50 split between both charities work ?
	Persuadee: So now we're donating to two different charities?
Persuader: i would suggest if you wanted to donate to both,you could donate half of what you wish to donate now to this charity, then you could donate the rest to the other charity if you wish in your own time, would you be willing to donate 30% to save the children now, this small amount really helps save the children stay a float.

Persuader: Nice.  You know every year around this time I try to give a little bit of money to charity, before the holidays start and I know I'm going to be broke. How about you? Do you usually give to charities?
	Persuadee: I give from time to time, if it's a good cause
Persuader: Nice.  What kinds of charities do you usually give to, if you don't mind me asking?
	Persuadee: I usually give to local charities that provide for the homeless.
Persuader: I do as well here in Chicago. Recently though, I've started to give more to charities that have to do with children. I feel like children are often the most as risk in disasters and conflict around the world. With them even just a little bit of money goes a long way in feeding them. Have you ever donated to a children's charity?
	Persuadee: I have donated to the McDonald house
Persuader: Nice. I remember seeing those commercials on TV.  One that I like is called Save the Children.  It's an organization that helps children in very difficult circumstances, both here in the US and around the world.  Have you heard of them before?
	Persuadee: Sounds like a good cause.  Do you have a website?
Persuader: Yes. It's  URL   There you will see the various projects they are working on.  For exaxmple, the work they are doing in Syria right now is incredibly important as there are unfortunately thousands upon thousands of orphans due to the war.
	Persuadee: Looks like they also help border children in the US.  I am all for that.
Persuader: Yes. I agree. That's also a very important endeavor.  There are just so many difficult situations out there for children.  But it's good to know at lease one organization tries to help the most in need.  Did you know that they accept donations from mturk?  So we could donate directly to them from our funds for this HIT.  Even small amounts go a long way when so many people donate.
	Persuadee: I can donate 50 cents right now, the rest goes into my childs college fund
Persuader: Ok. That sounds great.  I'm going to donate a similar amount myself
	Persuadee: sounds good, it is always worthwhile to donating something, nothing is too small
Persuader: I agree.  Especially with how many people are participating.  If everybody in America gave 1 dollar today, that would be 370 million.  It's amazing how many adds up
	Persuadee: Plus who doesn't want to help children?
Persuader: Exactly.  Well, you take care and enjoy the rest of your holiday. It was nice chatting with you
	Persuadee: Nice chatting with you too.",False,0.0
