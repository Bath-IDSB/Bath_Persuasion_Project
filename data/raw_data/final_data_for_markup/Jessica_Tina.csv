	Persuadee: Great! How are you?
Persuader: I am doing relatively well and fine. 
	Persuadee: What kind of person are you?
Persuader: Well, I believe that overall I am good person with a great drive to do as much for people in general.  Many have said that I am a giving and kind person.
	Persuadee: What kind good things do you do for people?
Persuader: Well, I basically help individuals who are closest to me by helping the elderly with very tasks locally.  I also have a tendency to help children around my neighbor by mentoring some.  I also help with my local congregation by a Godly person as well.
	Persuadee: You sound like a very nice and charitable individual. It is a pleasure to meet you!
Persuader: Well, thank I appreciate your kindness.  I try to do right by people.  I believe in the golden rule do unto others as you have them do unto you.

Persuader: Well, I believe in our children.  That is reason why I am a part of a cause to help children earth wide.  We are asking for any kind of monetary donation that you may have to help with the cause.
	Persuadee: I believe that helping children is a noble cause. How would my donation help these children? 
Persuader: Well, your donation would help on so many levels.  Your donation will help to the overall betterment, improved health, education, and safety of many of these children who come from a developing country.
	Persuadee: Why should I help these children? Are they not already being helped?
Persuader: Well, let me say this.  The children in these countries would like to have additional money provided because still in our modern day, it is still not enough to help.  That is one of the reasons why we are asking for more help.  There are many stories of children who have died from hunger but additional donations would be able to help to quell some of these isolated instances.
	Persuadee: That is very compelling. How much of a donation are you asking for?
Persuader: Well, any amount that you would like to offer would be greatly appreciated.  We like individuals to give from a joyful heart.  So whatever amount that you offer would be greatly appreciated and highly respected by our organization, the Save the Children fund.

Persuader: Not too bad. I'm excited to be volunteering my time to raise money for a children's charity. It's called Save the Children. 
	Persuadee: that's great that you volunteer. what kind of activities do you do for the children?
Persuader: Mostly what I do is try and encourage people to donate what they can to the cause. Save the Children has been around since 1919!  The funds are used to promote children's rights, better their education and health care and also provide emergency aid in situations of natural disaster. 
	Persuadee: do you know what countries they primarily donate to?

Persuader: In 2017, 155 million children were helped. There's always more to do though. How would you feel about helping Save the Children by donating some or all of your payment from this task?

Persuader: Even 10 cents is helpful. Thank you! That's great that you donate to animal charities. I support PAWS Chicago too. 
	Persuadee: the snamils need our help just as much as the children do. 
Persuader: No doubt! I just heard about a country does not kill rescue animals in shelters. So every shelter they run is a no-kill shelter. Have you heard that?

	Persuadee: No I am not. Can you tell me about it?
Persuader: They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries. It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.
	Persuadee: What can I do to help?
Persuader: I'm so glad you asked! One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. 
	Persuadee: Ok how much do you need?
Persuader: If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! Isn't that amazing? 
	Persuadee: That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.
Persuader: I know what you mean, I need to make money too. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. 
	Persuadee: I can't work all day.  I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.
Persuader: Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I have problems too. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day. I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...
	Persuadee: I have 10 cents I can give.
Persuader: That's awesome and generous! Thank you for doing this. I will also give money today. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!
	Persuadee: Wonderful.  I am so happy I can help.

Persuader: well it's a program for US children from the poorest families

	Persuadee: I do, they sound like a worthy organization
Persuader: For instance, much of their focus is on working with children in developing countries, and especially in war zones. That sounds like very important work to help children in those areas.
	Persuadee: It really does.  I'm impressed
Persuader: You should check out their website some time, it's  URL 
	Persuadee: Ok, I will be sure to do that.
Persuader: I just read there that in Syria, millions of children have grown up with a daily threat of violence. In January and February, around 1,000 children were killed or injured there. I can't imagine having to live in those kinds of conditions each day.
	Persuadee: I can't either.  We take so much for granted

Persuader: Save the Children is an International organization that ensures children's right to health, safety and education.
	Persuadee: Oh thats's amazing! Do doctors/nurses/teachers/etc. volunteer in order to provide services to the locations that the organization operates in?
Persuader: Save the Children is supported by all sorts of volunteers, including people like yourself who make small cash donations.
	Persuadee: Do they hold fundraisers like some of the other big name charities that tend to draw in celebritiries and other famous figures?
Persuader: They conduct relief efforts; they are preparing now to help children in Hawaii? I am not certain of all the ways they raise money though; I know they depend a lot on small donations.
	Persuadee: What issue(s) are going on in Hawaii that requires them to go there and provide aid?
Persuader: Hurricane like conditions; the Big Island just got thirty inches of rain.
	Persuadee: Wow, I'm surprised I didn't hear about that! Are they still operating in Puerto Rico? I know they are still rebuilding
Persuader: Yes, it is Hurricane Lane. I cannot imagine how scary it would be for a child to experience that type of weather. I am not sure about the specifics regarding Hurricane Maria, but Save the Children touches children's lives in a positive way all over the world. 155 million so far.
	Persuadee: Thats incredible. Are there setbacks due to politics or government interferences when going into certain countries?

	Persuadee: That's sad, it would be nice if children were not sick and hungry.
Persuader: she mam it would ,the little things is skin and bones ,they have no money for food and clothing
	Persuadee: It's too bad their parents don't have money to buy them food or clothes.  Does the government at least give them some food?
Persuader: i think they may donate some but not very much ,its so many people and chrildren going without ,starveing and going hungrey and the women over there keep getting pregnate with them knowing this its a shame
	Persuadee: It sounds like they could benefit from contraceptions.
Persuader: yes or maybe a tube clap surgrey.or something.they are just presious little kids that didnt ask to be brought in this world but they here and needs to be cared for and loved.
	Persuadee: Are they being adopted or staying with their parents?

Persuader: you can choose as many as you want and you tell the manger that is over save the chrldren and tell him them payment amount and if you want boys or girls or bough and he will set you up for the payments and he will send you all the informathion out bto you

Persuader: Hopefully it will be a good day :) Do you mind if I ask what kind of work you do?
	Persuadee: I actually work for a local television station in the middle of America.
Persuader: Oh wow that sounds fantastic! Were you ever involved in raising awareness about social issues? Like children in need?
	Persuadee: I've donated to a few charities before, but I've never been personally involved myself.
Persuader: I think you have a great platform for raising awareness so more people can donate to the cause
	Persuadee: That's true. I supposed I am in a good position. Unfortunately, I kind of just have a desk job, and don't really have anything to do with the news that is broadcast.
Persuader: Well nothing is lost there, you can maybe persuade some co-workers to bring it up higher in the chain. A few years back I was in India and even though I was mesmerized by the beauty of its rich culture I was overly sad to see many children in the streets who looked utterly malnutritioned and were begging in the streets. It broke my heart. So much so that I got involved with a few charities to help children around the world.
	Persuadee: Oh that's great!! I wish I had more time to travel and more money to give. I love the feeling when you know you're actually helping someone else.
Persuader: Its a great feeling. Especially now that I myself am a parent, I get even more depressed to see that in 2018, there are millions of children who suffer especially those in war zones. But you know, every little cent helps. You don't have to give hundreds or thousands. I have also worked in Baghdad during the war, and there were children in the streets selling packs of gum just to get a few cents here and there so they can survive.
	Persuadee: Oh my God. That's truly awful to know that children have to experience that. I would love to find a way to donate, even if it was just a little bit.
Persuader: Have you heard of ""Save the Children"" Charity? They do amazing wo? It only takes 77c a day to help provide shelter for refugees. They have many programs that you can participate in to help out.  
	Persuadee: Oh that's awesome!! What kind of programs do they provide?
Persuader: They target many causes. They provide education to teach children important skills. They also provide the best health and nutrition programs. They have a protection program and even programs for natural disaster areas. Imagine if 77c a day can provide shelter what would $1 or $2 dollars do?
	Persuadee: That's such a good point. Unfortunately, I'm in a really bad position monetarily right now. Is there any way I could donate even just a little bit?
Persuader: You are very kind, but like I said every little thing helps. How much would you feel comfortable to donate to the charity?
	Persuadee: Maybe 20 cents? I know that's not a lot, but it's all I can afford for the next couple days.
Persuader: Can you make it maybe 77c? Atleast you will feel good knowing that you are helping in providing shelter to these poor refugees.Your donation will be direclt deducted from your task payment but imagine what 77c would do for a child with no home...
	Persuadee: OK, I can donate 77 ceents

	Persuadee: How does the organization determine which children they will help?
Persuader: They try to help every kid they can, so, they operate all around the world
	Persuadee: Yes, but how do they identify chlidren to help? 
Persuader: They mostly look around UNICEF reports and other Human Rights Organizations
	Persuadee: Is there already an infrastructure if they want to approach a new village?
Persuader: They usually approach first by trying to get on the good side of the villagers, helping them with what they need, they only build infrastructure after they have gotten their permission, that way they don't intromise with their customs or rules
	Persuadee: What do you mean by intromise?
Persuader: Sometimes the villagers think that the organization volunteers are trying to change their customs or force them to accept something
	Persuadee: Sorry, I didn't recognize that word.
Persuader: So, would you like to donate to this organization?
	Persuadee: Sorry, I just don't think that I know enough about what exactly they do.
Persuader: Well, they pretty much help children, that's what they do, they try to give them a brighter future and give them the tools to progress instead of doing everything for them 
	Persuadee: But, for example, you can build a school, but if you don't enable the village to build, support, and potentiate a staff, it doesn't really do them any good.",False,0.0
932,"Persuader: Hi, have you ever heard of the charity ""Save the Children"" before?
	Persuadee: No I havent, please tell me more.
Persuader: Save the Children is a charity organization that provides funding to help get children access to health and education all over the world  
	Persuadee: That sounds great.  I think any childrens charity that is legitimate is worthy.  I am a big fan of St Jude's, I like the fact that they treat children but are also looking for a cure for diseases.
Persuader: Yeah St Jude's is a great organization that helps find cures for diseases.  There are a lot of other emergencies out there besides disease though, like disasters caused by weather or conflict and Save The Children provides money to help kids affected by that
	Persuadee: So the organization just funds local clinics but does not have any personal effect on treating children?
Persuader: Save the Children definitely has an effect on treating kids, they are active in over 120 countries and as well as providing funding to local organizations they also give direct aid like emergency supplies after a disaster. So they really can do it either way.  
	Persuadee: I feel so silly! Is ""Save the Children"" that organization that I see commercials for that shows sad underweight children with swollen tummies and says for the price of a cup of coffee each day you can sponsor a child.  Those are heartwrenching
Persuader: Yeah those commercials can be persuasive, there are so many different disasters affecting kids all over the world. The food insecurity in Africa is off the charts whenever there is a drought and Save the Children helps provide food to starving kids there. Any donation can really help provide more food.
	Persuadee: Thats wonderful, I definitely support helping those children.  I guess I dont think too much about them day to day, I kind of get consumed by the homelessness here in my city, or what our local church is funding at the moment.  But starving children deserve more wherever they are.  Its sad that we can never do enough
Persuader: Yeah its hard because wll live in such a connected world that you hear about so many awful things going on. On the positive side though in the past all of these awful things were happening but there were less mechanisms to help stop it. But for example this week thousands were displaced in Somali because of flooding but now Save the Children along with other organizations will go over there to help them.
	Persuadee: Thats great, what is their website so I can look more into it?
Persuader:  URL here you go
	Persuadee: Thank you! Do you also sponsor children yourself?
Persuader: I have but not directly with Save the Children, I have been active in other organizations though like Boys and Girls Club
	Persuadee: oh, thats a great organization also.  I always wondered if the kids really write letters, that would be really neat.
Persuader: Some do, but the sponsorship isn't just for a specific child it just goes into a fund. The kids write letters to people who put money into the fund. That allows them greater flexibility to move money around to where its needed
	Persuadee: Oh ok, well thats a shame.  But I am not discounting the cause.
Persuader: I think it really is more of a positive because if someone was to donate but later on in life they had to pause their donation for a time for some reason or another they wouldn't feel morally responsible for that child no longer being supported, because their would be other donors in the fund that would pick up the slack. 
	Persuadee: That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for sharing this with me, I will definitely look more into this charity!

	Persuadee: I am fine, and you?
Persuader: Doing really well. I was curious if you have any particular charities that you admire or donate to.
	Persuadee: No none in particular
Persuader: I've got a couple that I am interested in but sometimes I wonder if the money goes where they say, you know?
	Persuadee: Yea that is exactly how I feel as well, I like helping out but I dont want it to be in vain
Persuader: I did a survey on here a while back that laid out a couple charities really thoroughly and then offered to let me give up some of my ""reward"" for the survey to the charity. I thought it was an interesting idea. Plus sometimes I\'m just lazy and that\'s an easy uncomplicated way to do it.
	Persuadee: Yes, i do like that concept. However, I often wonder what a big difference it would really make
Persuader: Remember that ice bucket challenge thing that was super popular a while back? I thought it was fun but wouldn't do anything productive. Turns out they raised so much money it some drug trial through and they've found a drug that helps and is now on the market and that just blew me away. Downside of course is people still have to part with money they already had. I donated some of my reward to the charity because it wasn't really out of my pocket and I guess I figured every little bit might help.
	Persuadee: Oh wow, I never knew that! That is amazing what a difference we can make without thinking it would really make one
Persuader: I know and besides it got my son to dump a bucket of ice water on himself which was just hilarious.
	Persuadee: That is funny! Honestly, before the challenge I never even heard about ALS, so I guess it did its job by spreading awareness
Persuader: That's really true. Maybe on top of people not wanting the rigamarole of the donation process sometimes all we need is a better understanding of the need or just faith that a little from everyone can go a long way. 
	Persuadee: Yea, maybe more challenges can be done to spread awareness to diseases that often go unnoticed or unheard of
Persuader: Yeah, maybe, people just need information, ease of donating, and a sense of community about it all. This HIT we are doing is kind of doing the same thing as that other survey I did. We both get our base pay and then can choose to keep the added incentive or donate a portion of it to the charity Save the Children. I was contemplating giving some of mine away. I've worked overseas with kids through medical clinics and have seen how far what we think of as a small amount of money can really go.
	Persuadee: Yes, I am willing to donate a portion to the charity
Persuader: I was going to donate half of mine. Some for me for the work and some for them in the hopes it helps.  How much would you like to donate to Save the Children out of the payment?
	Persuadee: Yes I would like to donate .75 towards the foundation
Persuader: Brilliant. That's so kind of you. Between us both I hope it helps. And I love that they are giving their money to something other than profit, you know?

Persuader: I'm doing great. Out of curiousity, have you heard of the organization Save the Children?
	Persuadee: yes..i am very familiar..are you involved with charity
Persuader: Yes! I really prefer local charities but some nationwide and international ones are very dear to my heart. Whenever we have the opportunity to donate from our task rewards I always try to give a little bit.
	Persuadee: me too..i see many commercials for charity on TV and it breaks my heart.. i am also a follower of Unicef, are you familiar
Persuader: Yes, I've heard of Unicef. Another great organization. One thing I love about Save the Children is that they have very high ratings from third-party reportings. I know when I donate to them that my money is being used wisely!
	Persuadee: interesting, what do the ratings represent
Persuader: The ratings are from different companies such as Better Business Bureau and American Institute of Philanthropy. They actually get the financial reports from the IRS to confirm the accuracy in where the funds are going.
	Persuadee: very good...are you interested in other charities involved with children
Persuader: I have given to other organizations in the past, such as World Vision, but Save the Children is really important to me right now. There is such a lack of support right now in developing countries, and Save the Children really focuses on that.
	Persuadee: i happen to favor unicef since my kids collect for halloween and kids count monies as part of class project.
Persuader: I totally understand that. One thing I like about Save the Children is that it isn't just global but also focuses on kids in need here in the USA, especially the poverty-torn cities.
	Persuadee: i tend to give up to 100$ a month to children's org- what is your prefered donation?
Persuader: I typically give less than that, because I also give to my local church and other local organizations in my city.
	Persuadee: ah..what do you consider a fair donation per month
Persuader: Well, I just usually give $20 or $30 to a handful of charities that I love. But like I said, if the opportunity arises for me to donate some of my HIT reward to a charity, I will usually donate at least a small portion. Do you ever do that?
	Persuadee: i tend to give to people on the street asking for $$..there lots of opp...20 to 30 is fair amount
Persuader: You actually have the opportunity today to donate a portion of your task payment to Save the Children. How much would you like to put towards that? It can be any amount from just $0.10 to the full payment!
	Persuadee: hmm..interesting i will consider that..how would i contact them
Persuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it directly to Save the Children. You can just type the amount here you'd like to donate and it will be recorded for them to see.

Persuader: Great question! Save the Children works worldwide but primarily provides support in developing countries, especially in war zones.

Persuader: Yes, working with refugees is one of Save the Children's many priorities!
	Persuadee: How much of the donations they receive go to the work on the ground vs overhead costs, do you know?
Persuader: Good question. In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services.

Persuader: Yes! Only 14% is spent on management and fundraising. As far as staff, we have global advocates who provide services but also make sure to provide local staff that is familiar with the locations needs.

Persuader: There just isn't the population to warrant it. The climate is not sustainable for human life and children do not reside there. But in the other countries they provide emergency response, global advocacy,  literacy, and health education. 
	Persuadee: Well that's disappointing. What country receives the most aid?
Persuader: It is spread out by need but rest assured that their charity ranges from Kentucky all the way to Kenya. Also, 86% of all expenditures go to program services so everyone that donates knows that their money is being used for a good cause rather than misappropriated.

Persuader: I completely understand.  It wouldn't be much.  Every little bit counts.  In the first two months of this year alone 1000 children were killed or injured due to violence in developing nations.  All were asking for is a $2 donation to ensure that children affected can get access to the resources they need to live a healthy and prosperous life.

There are children across the world right now who need school supplies for education that we take for granted with it starting up again soon!

Persuader: There is an inital upfront cost of building the base for our organization in a location, and then the majority of costs are aimed towards helping the kids in that area.

	Persuadee: I feel the same way. If to much money is going to the administrators that is not good. 
Persuader: Yes, sort of defeats the purpose in my opinion. So are there any other questions I could answer for you before you decide how much you'd like to donate?
	Persuadee: Where does the money go? What countries?
Persuader: So right now the organization is in 120 countries, which is pretty incredible. It goes to many many things, such as, shelter for refugee families, healthcare - funding hospitals and programs, education - funding schools and programs, food/shelter options...

Persuader: So people donate anywhere from just a few cents to as much as they possibly can given the fact that the money is well used. To give you an idea, 77 cents a day can provide shelter for a refugee family.

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

	Persuadee: What countries has the charity worked in recently? 
Persuader: Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now. Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries. In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter.
	Persuadee: Wow that sounds like a really robust program. How long has Save the Children been around?
Persuader: It was founded in 1919, on April 15th in London - UK.

A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want. Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars. For every cent you donate it will come directly from your task payment.

Persuader: Sure, absolutely. In 2017, 86% went to Program services - or services that directly help aid these children. 9% went towards fundraising efforts, and 5% went towards our Management & other general costs. In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers.
	Persuadee: That's pretty impressive! Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.

Persuader: Mim, in Bangladesh is 7 years old, and wants to become a teacher. It could go towards her education, because in her country the average girl only stays in school until 10 years old. But more likely, it will be going towards meals or daily living expenses, with the average parent from her country only earning $3 a day.
	Persuadee: How much does a $1 dollar donation change a child like Mim's situation?
Persuader: As you can see, $1 will change their world. One more meal or a pair of shoes will be one less thing that Mim, and her parents need to worry about. Bangladesh has been one of the largest parts of that Rohingya refugee exodus from Myanmar that I mentioned before and have been struggling themselves taking on more than 655,000 extra people. This has caused further hardship on an already hardened country.
