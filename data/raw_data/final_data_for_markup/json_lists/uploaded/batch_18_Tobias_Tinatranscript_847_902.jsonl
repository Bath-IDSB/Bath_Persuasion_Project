I mean I can only afford a little otherwise I wouldn't be doing HITS...;)\nPersuader: I usually donate just a small amount between like 10 and 30 cents, even just a small amount makes a big difference because there are so many of us each helping a small amount.\n\tPersuadee: sounds like a good idea, you think $.10 is good enough?\nPersuader: It most certainly is - every bit is appreciated! The kids will benefit greatly from this as the researchers have been doing hundreds of HITs so it really does add up when everyone donates a small amount.\n\tPersuadee: are you going to donate?\nPersuader: I'm going to donate $.30 - today has been a good day for HITs so it won't kill me heh. And just think how many other pairs of people are making the same decision! \n\tPersuadee: I know I hope the researchers raise a lot of money through this...\nPersuader: It'd be cool if they showed us at the end of the study how much has been raised so far, I'd really like that.\n\tPersuadee: I know it would make all the people who did this HIT feel good unless their not really caring people then well...", "idx": "847"}

This isn\\'t like a guy on your TV next to impoverished children. They really are making a difference.\n\tPersuadee: That\\'s good, I\\'ve heard good things about \"Save the Children\". I\\'d donate my whole $2 to them.\nPersuader: Wow! That's great news! Your proceeds will help children in need all around the world!\n\tPersuadee: That's is pretty cool.

I was actually adopted from Thailand by Holt. I highly recommend them also.\n\tPersuadee: Holt? Is that a children's charity? I've never heard of them.\nPersuader: Yes they are. There were started during the Korean war and the couple were saving orphans from the war. I donate to Holt every year.\n\tPersuadee: Wow, it sounds like a charity my husband and I will have to investigate. We like to donate through our church to various charities and they're always looking for something new.\nPersuader: They are great since they help orphans and they also get children adopted. They are in most third world countries.\n\tPersuadee: Interesting, do they solicit donations or is a word of mouth charity? I ask because if they solicit they usually have a web page and a brochure for people to look over.\nPersuader: They are based out of Washington state. I usually get mail from them and you can sponsor particular children and get quarterly updates.\n\tPersuadee: Nice, I\\'ll look in to it.

{"text": "Persuader: How would you like to donate to Save the Children, a wonderful charity that helps children with health, education and your donation can make a big difference!\n\tPersuadee: That sounds interesting but can you tell me more?\nPersuader: Often children have a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.\n\tPersuadee: Where is the charity headquartered?\nPersuader: 501 Kings Highway East, Suite 400 Fairfield, CT 06825, if that helps.\n\tPersuadee: Please forgive me for the questions but I have to ask as I have been scammed by so called charities before.  How many children do you help?\nPersuader: I completely understand and it is hard to know in today's world, we have helped 155 million children to this day!\n\tPersuadee: That sounds like a lot! Wow!

I live on SSI and don't make much. Thank you for letting me know how much of my money actually goes to the children. I was just about to ask that.  How can I donate the $2.00?  Check/Credit Card/Pay Pal?\nPersuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.\n\tPersuadee: Oh ok. Is it tax deductible do you know?\nPersuader: Yes it is.\n\tPersuadee: Will I get a picture and/or a letter from the child I am helping?\nPersuader: I think that is only for large and monthly donations, however I will even match your donation in whatever you give.\n\tPersuadee: I would be happy to donate to Save the Children!\nPersuader: Wonderful!

These organizations only ask for a small amount that we may spend on coffee each day or snacks we don't need.\n\tPersuadee: I hear you. I do believe in donations, but my only worry is that the money doesn't go to where I think it is going. I prefer to volunteer is I can\nPersuader: That's a good idea actually, that way you know for sure your efforts are helping.\n\tPersuadee: But the places I do donate are often revolved around helping children, so this is a great organization\nPersuader: It only takes pocket change for us to help out. \n\tPersuadee: I agree. you never know who you could be helping\nPersuader: Do your family or friends donate to such causes?\n\tPersuadee: We do. My mom is on the board for a few nonprofits that we attend fundraisers for. That is a great way to raise money\nPersuader: Wow.  Well you've seen charity first-hand.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I try to help as much as I can, but it's hard when you are broke\nPersuader: I definitely understand.  Sometimes it's more a matter of convenience, too.  It doesn't take much to save 30c a week or something.\n\tPersuadee: that is true, but its hard to justify that 30c is going to make any difference\nPersuader: Well,in America, of course that's nothing.

I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.  I do the same for World Vision.  I sponsor 3 children.\nPersuader: That's amazing.  When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.  We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.  So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.   \n\tPersuadee: I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.  Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.  How long have you been donating?\nPersuader: For years.  I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.  You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.  Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.  I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.  \n\tPersuadee: That is good.  I've heard good things about Save the Children.  I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.  I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.  I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.\nPersuader: Absolutely. We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.  You know what, you've encouraged me.  I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.  You want to join me?  It won't be much but every penny counts.  We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.  \n\tPersuadee: Sure.  I would love to help.  I would love to make a donation today.\nPersuader: That's amazing.  Should we give our whole 30 cents?  It's not like either of us can do much with that either.\n\tPersuadee: Probably more.  Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?\nPersuader: I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.  Hassle free.  \n\tPersuadee: Ok, sounds good.  I'll donate the whole amount.\nPersuader: I'm so glad I got partnered with you.  With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.\n\tPersuadee: Great.  I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.  Thanks for sharing.\nPersuader: Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.  So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.  I'm going to blog about you later today.  It will encourage our friends.  \n\tPersuadee: Very good.  I glad we can help.  Every bit helps. \nPersuader: Nice to meet you fellow Turker. You've encouraged my heart today.\n\tPersuadee: Ditto to you. Have a great day. God bless!\nPersuader: Goodbye.

There's a lot of charities out there, what makes yours special?\nPersuader: Let me ask you this, do you have children?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I have one child. He's four.\nPersuader: Perfect. Now I want you to imagine how your child's life would be if he was alone, bouncing from foster home to foster home. Imagine him with no strong mentor or leader in his life. How does that make you feel?\n\tPersuadee: I would suppose that it would be a rough life, but even if I did want to donate to a children's charity specifically, why would I choose yours out of all of them?\nPersuader: You should pick my charity because we pride ourselves on transparency. If you were to give me $0.50 today I could tell you exactly where all the money was to go. You want to know where? It's going straight into a college fund for a foster child. \n\tPersuadee: If I did decide to donate to you, what would the average donation be? \nPersuader: The average donation is 25 cents to 50 cents. Anything helps\n\tPersuadee: Well, I think I would like to send a donation, but first I still want to know a little bit more. Does every single penny go towards the foster children or does the donation company keep a percentage of the profits?\nPersuader: For all of our donations from individuals, 100% of the proceeds go to the child. The charity runs from larger donations from corporations. \n\tPersuadee: That's good to hear, I'm feeling more inclined to donate now, but could you first tell me more about who runs the charity operations? or if there's any other uses that this money will go towards outside of college funds?\nPersuader: The charity has a dedicated operations team that has been running the ship for over a decade now. We do take donations for things other than college funds, including: food donations, clothing etc. I just work on the college team\n\tPersuadee: That's fair, well, I guess that it wouldn't hurt to give some money to your charity. How do I go about doing that?\nPersuader: It's pretty easy, the donation can be deducted from your task payment. \n\tPersuadee: Alright, well, once we've finished up here then I will be sure to do that.\nPersuader: Thank you so much for your donation, it really might not seem like much.

However they do have other programs as well that helps keep them moving.  You can become a monthly donor, sponsor a child, shop the gift catalog from their website, or there's the Make a one-time gift program, which is what I'm here for!\n\tPersuadee: How much can they really do with a couple of bucks though?\nPersuader: They can feed entire camps with several couple dollars! That's how they're funded! They get running water and electricity to children that need it.  Just a few bucks adds up when its coming from a couple of people, you know?\n\tPersuadee: I guess so.  Seems they have many supporters, makes me feel like mine drop in the bucket is meaningless.\nPersuader: I don't think so at all. It makes you a contributor to a wonderful cause, not a drop in a bucket! If a few bucks was the difference between getting child(ren) out of a hostile living environment and into one more stable, wouldn't that mean something to you? That definitely could be the case. It's not meaningless. It's a valued contribution.\n\tPersuadee: I would possibly donate at some point\nPersuader: That's great to hear and you have the perfect opportunity right now. \n\tPersuadee: I want to be able to give more than $2.  I will consider giving in the future.  \nPersuader: You could give the $2 from chatting with me about this cause and donate again - by any one of those means that I mentioned above in any amount that you are satisfied with.  It's free money going to a good cause and it all gets taken care of directly from here. \n\tPersuadee: I prefer to give directly through the website.  I am here to make money.\nPersuader: That's so unfortunate. It's basically giving free money to children who have no essentially nothing and you're still getting paid whether you donate or not. \n\tPersuadee: I understand where you are coming from, I just prefer to give on my own time.", "idx": "861"}

Yes, the money is small, but some tasks are easier than others\n\tPersuadee: Because between other workers not being smart and people rejecting for no reason, every HIT is a gamble.\nPersuader: Other people not being smart?

I don't have much money to spend either but I am willing to help out a little.  Would you be willing to donate some of the money you earn from this task to a charity?\n\tPersuadee: Actually, I might. I have been reading a book called \"The Secret\" and one thing it teaches is that to get more money you have to give money. Is there a specifc charity that I should donate to?\nPersuader: Yes I am a big fan of the Save the Children charity.  They are one of the most trusted charities in the world and really make a difference in helping protect and keep children alive and in a safe enviroment.\n\tPersuadee: I do love kids. I have three grown kids and eleven grandkids!! It breaks my heart to think about children suffering. Do they help out in the US as well as other countries?\nPersuader: As many as 190 different contries this charity is helping out.  Where help is needed most is decided by experts in the field.  For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.\n\tPersuadee: That really is very sad.

What would you be willing to donate today?  \n\tPersuadee: I will donate all of what I earn from this task today. Perhaps it will garner me some good karma with the universe.\nPersuader: That is what I like to hear.  Because of your kindness and well spoken words,  I will be donating all as well.  The total donation amount for each of us would be $2.00.  Would you like to confirm that account now?\n\tPersuadee: Sure, why not? I will donate the entire $2.00. It will send good vibes out to the universe and we will both benefit from our good deeds.

Are you from the United States or do you live elsewhere?\nPersuader: born, bred, and an air force veteran here in the US\n\tPersuadee: Thank you for your service! I didn't just want to assume that we are both from the US. Although I agree that charities like the Save the Children are important just like children/people of developing countries are important, there are A LOT of children in the U.S. that are in major need of help. I understand that there is a difference but there are a lot of starving children here too that need just as much help.\nPersuader: there are indeed a lot of people here that need help as well, but those people here have better access to government and private services and programs, most people in developing countries do not, in the books ive read lots of children beg for MREs and bottles of water from soldiers, id like to never have to read about that in another military biography, don't you agree?\n\tPersuadee: I do agree. I also agree that people here have better access to gov't assistance. That being said, as a foster parent, it is my experience that children here starve, too. Not that I am saying I don't want to help anyone outside of this country. I have and will again. I am saying I am only one person and if I have to choose one or the other I will help here first, then, if I have enough to go around I would be happy to help in other places...\nPersuader: well thank you for being a foster parent, a very noble thing.

I guess that makes me seem a little selfish but 10 cents will but a pack of noodles that will feed 2 kids at my house. \nPersuader: alright well if you cant donate i understand can you please state for the requesters how much you would like to donate to make if offical anywhere between 0 and 2 dollars\n\tPersuadee: Thank you, again for your service.

It's one of my favorite parts about Save the Children.

Kind of goes without saying I suppose :) Is there a reason you don't currently donate to this charity?\n\tPersuadee: I help support my own grandchildren whose parents are having a lot of difficulty in the current economy. I have also experienced a significant loss of income, thus working on Mturk to make ends meet.\nPersuader: That's very awesome of you and I am sorry to hear of your recent loss of income. I understand needing MTurk for supplemental income as our family is single income right now and sometimes its rough living paycheck to paycheck! I think that is why this opportunity is so unique today. The donation you choose to commit (which can be as little as 1 cent) will be deducted from the payment for this HIT and automatically sent to save the children by the requestor. \n\tPersuadee: Well, I think I could probably send at least 50 cents, will you be able to match that amount?\nPersuader: The payment for this HIT is 30 cents (at least on my end) and I don't think we can exceed that amount.

If I can ask a personal question, how did you make room in your finances to donate?  \nPersuader: I did't I just gave what I thougt cas right and took the blow . I thought about how these kids do without so much and realized I could do without once in order to help someone in need\n\tPersuadee: So how did you decide what was right for you? \nPersuader: I gave what was given to me . Over the next few chats I'm going to tell you the story of Bruce a child that like alot of these chidren need help but threw Save The Chidren found it. At the end Of our next few chats I'm going to ask you to  donate what you earn from this survey . I want you to think about what it means to save a child thats in trouble and how by saving that child you find new hope in your own life.\n\tPersuadee: I'm certainly willing to listen. Tell me about Bruce.\nPersuader: Bruce was born to a single mother who was only 14 at the time he came into this world , the girls mother and father were ashamed of her pregnancy and kicked out of the house. Bruce was born and taken from the girl because she was to young to raise him and her was adobted out to a poor family that did their best to provide for him . The founder of save the children heard about the family and learned of Bruces story . He came to meet Bruce .\n\tPersuadee: That poor girl, being rejected by her own family like that. I'm glad that Bruce was taken in, though. How did the visit go?\nPersuader: The owner got involved in Bruces life and sav the children went to work and provide food and cloths and school needs for Bruce . Bruce went own to join the save the children foundation after he completed college and is helping save children today. \n\tPersuadee: That's awesome! He even made it through college. I can see how he'd be really devoted to the organization, given the impact they had on his life.\nPersuader: Yes he is a force for good and was saved out of tragedy.\n\tPersuadee: If only all kids were so lucky. But I guess it takes a lot of work to try to help the ones who need it most\nPersuader: Now I would Like to ask you to donate what you about to receive and and give to other in need. Yiur will go to help other just like that right now are looking or in room by themselves hoping for a miracle .Will you be that miracle and help a child like Bruce today? \n\tPersuadee: I will. Be the change you want to see in the world, right?\nPersuader: Yes you will . So how much of your earnings will you give, for a child that needs to be saved today?.\n\tPersuadee: 5 dollars buys a latte, and I think it should be easy for me to give up a coffee a month. I bet they have ways to set up recurring donations pretty easily.\nPersuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children", "idx": "875"}

Food? Clothing? Shelter? Education?\nPersuader: They help in the children's basic need like food and clothing. They help in whatever it takes for children to transforming their lives and the future\n\tPersuadee: Is this charity local?  global?  Just in my country (United States)?\nPersuader: This charity is from Fairfield Town in Connecticut\n\tPersuadee: I think  it's important to support initiatives to help children get a good education, and have the things they need to go to school and learn.  How much should we donate?\nPersuader: Ya.. It's very important. There are many way to donate money like one time gift, Monthly donor, and sponsorship for some children. \n\tPersuadee: Sponsorship of a child might be interesting....I'd like to know what my donation is being used for, and that it's actually helping someone. \nPersuader: Child sponsorship works like a way of giving and that connects one compassionate person like you with one child in need. Sponsoring a child gives the chance to grow up healthy, educated and safe _ forever changing the course of their life and future. You can select a child according to your choice by age, gender \n\tPersuadee: That is appealing. Does the charity send updates on how the child is doing if I sponsor?\nPersuader: Ya... Definitely they will update you every information about the child you are donating\n\tPersuadee: How does the sponsorship work?  Do I make a monthly donation? I can't afford much. What is the minimum dollar amount?\nPersuader: You can Sponsor a child for just $36 a month\n\tPersuadee: Let's say for this experiment, we will contribute the $36 a month for six months, and see how it goes. We can renew for another six months it it looks like the donation is working. What do you think?\nPersuader: Ya.. It will definitely work and save the children's future..\n\tPersuadee: OK. Glad that we came to an agreement.  How do we end this task?", "idx": "876"}
{"text": "Persuader: Have you heard of the Save the children foundation?\n\tPersuadee: I haven't heard about this foundation. Would it be related to children lost to cults or terrorist groups?\nPersuader: Save the children helps young ones affected by disasters of all kinds\n\tPersuadee: I see. Are these children specifically from poor countries? Or may it included children affected by, let's say, Hurricane Katrina back in 2005?\nPersuader: There is a US Program as well as a global outlet\n\tPersuadee: That is good to hear. How specifically will these children be helped? Will the foundation only provide homes? Or is there more to it?\nPersuader: There's definitely more to it STC provides advocacy, education, protection, and food among other services\n\tPersuadee: So it seems that the STC is an all around foundation, aiming to prevent disasters from stunting the progress of young ones. Do you think the foundation is part of the first helpers to a disaster? Or is it a more gradual affect they provide? \nPersuader: The foundation is with children every step of the way from the initial stages of an event to the residual effects months/years later STC looks to help\n\tPersuadee: I do believe being there for every step of the way can really improve the child's chances for success, which is heartwarming. Since I have not heard of the foundation from the start, do you think there impact is less great, than other foundations that are known, such as Red Cross?\nPersuader: Every organization has it's own impact. STC reached 155 million children during 2017 235,000 of which were in the United States. That's a pretty big impact. You can view more stats here  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report\n\tPersuadee: That is a huge impact. I have quickly researched the foundation, and have seen some of these stats. It seems even corporations are involved with the foundation, such as the CEO of Chobani, who believes we should save every child possible. I believe that more companies, like chobani, should partner and donate some of the proceedings they receive to help the children. Do you agree? \nPersuader: Yes I do. Support from corporations would really help in communities across the world\n\tPersuadee: Refering back to the aid STC provides, do you think it is better to provide emergency assistance, just days or weeks after the disaster, or provide gradual assistance after the initial affects of the disaster has been solved? Do you think the foundation needs to pick and choose based on the funding they have?\nPersuader: STC does strive to meet needs at both times, however emphasis is placed on emergency services because it is believed that is when children are most vulnerable. With proper funding we will be able to continue assisting through out the entire process. You can help How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).\n\tPersuadee: That makes a lot of sense, a good basis can propagate to the next few months. I have always been reluctant in donating to such foundations, due to many corruptions in this industry. It is said that most of these foundations are Non-Profit, however, some of these foundations provide false help. I have read that Red Cross showed up at a disaster with empty trucks, just for publicity. How can I know for sure any of these foundations are legit?\nPersuader: I definitely understand Our independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. We keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.   In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services.   \n\tPersuadee: Reports on the financials of the company/foundation is very important, and I appreciate the search for the statistics. I do believe statistics like these can help and persuade people to donate more. I do believe that the government should make such reports mandatory, and even possibly provide a certain status to those foundations that do use a majority of their revenue for the purposes they claim. Do you think the government should involve themselves in such scandals that may occur?\nPersuader: Government involvement may be necessary in those cases. Thankfully STC doesn't have anything to worry about in that department. Would you be willing to donate today?\n\tPersuadee: I appreciate the conversation and all the statistics you have given me, however, I will not be donating to said foundation. I believe a good majority of these foundations make false claims. I would be willing to volunteer, but I will not give hard earned money to something that would go against my beliefs against corporate corruption.", "idx": "877"}

It is such a simple and easy way to make an impact if one wanted to.\n\tPersuadee: What percent of donations go to staff, administrative costs, etc.?\nPersuader: 9 of every 10 dollars goes directly to children in need! So only 10% to administrative costs. The other thing is that we can help a child by donating the cost of a candy bar! \n\tPersuadee: How is the money distributed? Who precisely is performing the relief help?\nPersuader: Volunteers provide the relief work through a variety of programs and emergency aid. The money is distributed where it is needed most - so if there is an emergency more money will go there. But there is a question that I would like to ask you.\n\tPersuadee: Go ahead, ask.\nPersuader: Would you be willing to donate $0.20 to the relief work if I match the donation from this Mturk task?

It has a very low overhead and almost all the money donated to it is directly used to help children.\n\tPersuadee: I know that it is a good organization and I support them.  However I am not getting a reward from this hit.  I am spending my time completing it so I am being paid for a job.  I want the money to do with as I choose.\nPersuader: Save the Children has helped build hundreds of schools in developing nations around the world. They've educated many children who have gone on to do important medical and other life saving jobs.\n\tPersuadee: I still do not want to make a donation from this money.\nPersuader: Another example is in Syria over 1,000 children have already been killed this year! Save the Children is helping to evacuate as many children as possible from that country. Don't you think every child deserves a long and happy life?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I do think that they do.\nPersuader: Don't you want to be part of the solution by giving as much money as possible to Save the Children so they can help as many children as possible?\n\tPersuadee: I do not want to make a donation today.\nPersuader: Think about how you were probably going to just waste the measly reward amount you were being offered for this HIT on junk food or coffee and think about what amazing things Save the Children would be able to do with that money.\n\tPersuadee: I am not going to waste the reward.  I use it for things that my family needs.\nPersuader: Think about how much more those poor kids in developing countries needs the money. Your family is rich enough to live in a first world country and have food on a daily basis. By not donating this tiny amount you're directly allowing children to sufer.\n\tPersuadee: We work for everything that we have.  Nothing is just given to us soooo I am not going to give away something that I work for unless I want to do so.\nPersuader: Of course you work for everything you own. By helping Save the Children you will directly be allowing a child to grow up and work for things him or herself rather than living in poverty and possibly not even making it out of childhood.\n\tPersuadee: It still does not change the fact that I am not going to make a donation with this money.\nPersuader: Save the Children will even let you know about the specific child that your money is helping. So you will really get to know that one child. It's not just some faceless organization with faceless non existant children. Everything is completly real and on the up and up.\n\tPersuadee: I understand this and have supported Unbound a similar charity for years.  Since I already donate to a charity like this I am not making a donation. \nPersuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.\n\tPersuadee: I will not donate anything $0.", "idx": "889"}

Just had dinner.\nPersuader: Glad to hear it. I was wondering- have you ever heard of an organization called Save the Children? If not, I was hoping I could tell you a bit about what they do\n\tPersuadee: I have briefly heard about it but I don't know much about it so I'd love to hear more.\nPersuader: I appreciate your openness. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. They rely solely on donations from people like you and I to help ensure children have access to healthcare, education, etc. \n\tPersuadee: Do they help children in the U.S. as well?\nPersuader: Absolutely- all over the world. They are a really amazing organization. \n\tPersuadee: Wow, that's pretty huge. Are there minimums for small donations if you don't have alot of money but want to donate?\nPersuader: No minimums whatsoever! I have friends that donate $5/month and it makes such a huge difference in the lives of these children. \n\tPersuadee: I can imagine little bits adding up pretty quick if many people pitch in for such a great cause.\nPersuader: Exactly. And actually, I hope you don't mind me asking, but might you be willing to donate some or all of the money you're receiving for this specific task ($2) to the Save the Children organization? \n\tPersuadee: I don't mind at all. I would like to donate $1.00 to this charity! Thank for the opportunity to get involved.\nPersuader: You are amazing- thank you so much for your generosity!! There are so many worthy causes out there but this one definitely holds a special place in my heart. \n\tPersuadee: I think I will look this one up to learn more. You are very welcome.\nPersuader: I would encourage it- the website is  URL  Do you have children of your own?\n\tPersuadee: Thank you for the website. Yes I have three children. Two are out of the house and grown. My youngest is 12.\nPersuader: How lovely!

Do you ever donate to charity organizations?\n\tPersuadee: I almost never donate. Do you?\nPersuader: I definitely do if I believe in the mission of the organization.  This particular organization is helping the future of our world by ensuring that children's rights are protected all over \n\tPersuadee: That sounds really great.

Your donation would be directly deducted from your task payment.  You can choose any amount!\n\tPersuadee: I'd like to donate $0.50\nPersuader: That is fantastic, thank you!  The researchers running this task will make sure that the organization receives your donation!\n\tPersuadee: Awesome! So how exactly does the organization ensure that children's rights are protected?\nPersuader: In the U.S. and around the world, they give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. When crisis strikes, they are always among the first to respond and the last to leave. We do whatever it takes to save children, transforming their lives and the future we share.\n\tPersuadee: Wow, that is amazing. How long have you been involved?\nPersuader: I've been involved with the organization for about a year now and have learned so much about their mission. They help children here at home and abroad\n\tPersuadee: And what do you do at the organization?\nPersuader: I help promote the organization by speaking to people just like you and helping to generate donations.  Since the organization is not for profit, donations from individuals and organizations help them acheive their mission\n\tPersuadee: Good for you! I would definitely love to donate and get involved in any way I can.\nPersuader: that is great! I would like to personally thank you for your donation today!\n\tPersuadee: No problem! Thank you!

Do all the proceeds go to the children?\nPersuader: They of course have to pay for their employs and transportation and other things but the majority goes to the children and helps them, they are very transparent about their finances. \n\tPersuadee: That makes sense. Do you know if they have locations where people can volunteer?\nPersuader: i dont know this information but i think if you google it you can find it, what about the donation? what you think=?\n\tPersuadee: I dont think I am going to donate today but I will keep the name of the charity in case I decide to donate on another day\nPersuader: i really think that you will help some children with your donation. why you dont want to donate? is there a specific reason?\n\tPersuadee: Like I said before I like to take the time to research the charity  before I donate, so I would want to do some reasearch before just agreeing to donate.\nPersuader: Fair enough, you are right. which charity to you like most? \n\tPersuadee: There are quite a few, I dont remember their exact names, but I am a big dog fan so anything to help dogs find a family.

Hundreds of thousands of children die every year because of hunger, and millions don't have access to quality, healthcare and education.\n\tPersuadee: Can you tell me more about it?\nPersuader: Sure. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Your donation, and other MTurkers' donations, are essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc. Your donation will make a tangible impact for the world\n\tPersuadee: This sounds like a great charitable cause.\nPersuader: It is. There is a lack of support for children in developing countries. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Do you think you would be interested in donating?\n\tPersuadee: As a matter of fact, I have been ocassionally donating to a few causes like Feeding America in the past few years.\nPersuader: That's great! Thank you for doing that. And a little bit of money goes a long way in these organizations. Just 77 cents a day can shelter a refugee family for a day. Do you have any children?  \n\tPersuadee: No, I am unmarried and thus do not have children yet.\nPersuader: I have four kids and it breaks my heart to think of others suffering so much in the rest of the world, and Save the Children is a great and trusted organization. You can rest assured that your money will go toward helping children with what they need the most. Can the organization count on your donation from this hit?  \n\tPersuadee: I sincerely admire how much you actually care for others. Unfortunately, I don't think I would like to donate this time.\nPersuader: That's unfortunate. Even 50 cents would help! Can I count on you for that?\n\tPersuadee: In this case, perhaps I can do my part by donating 20 cents.\nPersuader: That would be great! You won't regret it. Every little bit helps. \n\tPersuadee: I hope this small amount does help.\nPersuader: Small donations will indeed help a lot of children and their families.\n\tPersuadee: Okay then, let's do this. So how exactly can I do this and how do I donate?\nPersuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. I'm guessing you'll be prompted after our chat ends.\n\tPersuadee: Alright then, thank you for sharing this information to me. I hope you have a nice day.\nPersuader: Thanks for the chat!

How are you?  I am not a parent. \nPersuader: I'm really good.  I have three children in high school.  I always wanted more children and I think that is why I am so passionate about Save the Children.  Do you donate to any children's charities?\n\tPersuadee: No, I have never donated to any children's charities. I usually donate to other causes.\nPersuader: Personally, I only donate to two causes.  I donate to a local Down Syndrome Organization and Save the Children.  I have found that many charities are making the organizers rich and the money doesn't always go toward causes I believe in.  Have you heard of Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: I have only heard of Save the Children from doing HITs on mTurk.  Its a commonly referenced charity...so much so that I am convinced its not real lol\nPersuader: Lol!  I have seen it several times as well, but I assure you, it is real.  Donations to Save the Children ensure children's right to health, education and safety.  I prefer helping people in my own community, however, I feel that Save the Children is so important to children in the USA and other countries.  Today, I am only looking for a small donation.

Donating would be a nice thing to do\nPersuader: Sometimes I doubt what I see on mTurk too!  I wanted to assure you the organization is real.  Did you see that half of refugees are children and 77 cents a day can provide shelter for an entire family?\n\tPersuadee: Yeah I did.  Its hard to believe that so little can do so much!\nPersuader: When I saw that, it made me feel terrible.  Just yesterday I spent twice that on a fountain drink at a gas station.  I drank half of it and threw the rest away.  Did you have an amount you were thinking of donating?\n\tPersuadee: Yeah its amazing when you think about how much we waste in our day to day lives.  A dollar seems like a good amount to donate. \nPersuader: Like I said, I am only looking for small donations today, so $1 would be fantastic!  \n\tPersuadee: Alright great.  A dollar it is!\nPersuader: The research team will collect all donations and send them to Save the Children\n\tPersuadee: OK, its just good to know that Save the Children is actually real\nPersuader: I agree.  I always do mTurk hits as a way to save for a family vacation.  I rarely donate when they ask because I'm never sure they are real or if it's a way for the requester to save money.
