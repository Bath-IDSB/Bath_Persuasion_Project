Persuader: great! Well, have you ever heard about Save the Children charity?

Persuader: it's an international non-governemntal organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries

	Persuadee: interesting. So if i donate will 100% of my donation go to a child?
Persuader: 86% goes to help children, 9% goes to fundraising and 5% goes to management and other things. 
	Persuadee: i just don't know why i've never heard about it
Persuader: neither do i! It's such a well known charity! It just so sad to see children from developing countries die from easily preventable deseases
	Persuadee: it is sad, i agree with you 
Persuader: million of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. You said you have a kid. Imagine your precious child going through it every day. waking up every day being afraid of getting killed
	Persuadee: that breaks my heart. I would do anything to protect my son

	Persuadee: Great! Yourself?
Persuader: Great- thanks!  I was wondering if you might have a few minutes to talk about a charity which does some great work for underpriviledged children?  It's called Save the Children.
	Persuadee: I absolutely have the time
Persuader: Thanks!  This is an international non-governmental organization which travels to a variety of countries to help kids who don't have homes, education, adequate food and drinking water.  
	Persuadee: How can I help?
Persuader: The organization is looking for donations to set up a system of permanent self-sustainment.  Funds would be used to create a simple drinking water filtration system and to fund schools to teach life skills, such as crop growth and crafting skills to start a small business.  Would you be interested in helping their efforts?
	Persuadee: I could help a bit
Persuader: Every bit is really appreciated!  Just so you know, the Save the Children organization has been recognized with numerous humanitarian awards from a variety of organizations and countries.  
	Persuadee: Wow, that is a great accomplishment
Persuader: I'd also be happy to put you in touch with a sponsored child if you'd be interested?  You would be able to monitoring his or her growth and development of the area in which he or she lives.
	Persuadee: That would be great. What is the typical donation?
Persuader: Donations typically run anywhere up to $2.  This small amount of money can accomplish a surprising amount within an underdeveloped country. 
	Persuadee: I can definitely afford $2. How will i recieve information regarding the sponsored child?
Persuader: That's very kind of you!  You can find more information on the sponsorship at their website-  URL 
	Persuadee: Okay great, thank you for the information!
Persuader: It's my pleasure :)  Keep in mind also that your donation is tax deductible!
	Persuadee: I wasn't aware, I will keep that in mind! Thanks!
Persuader: The organization is very lucky that generosity such as yours exists.  Without it, many children's lives would be even worse.  Have an amazing evening!!

736,"Persuader: Hello my name is Steven.
	Persuadee: Hi my name is Donna   what's yours?
Persuader: My name is Steven.  Do you actively donate to charity?  Have you ever heard of Save the Children?
	Persuadee: Sorry Steven  I saw your name after I asked.Yes I often monthly really donate to a charity in the Gobi .I have heard and at one point did activly donated to Save The Children.Thank you for asking
Persuader: Save the Children is a wonderful organization.  They promote children's rights and provide relief to support children in developing countries.  Many children around the world benefit from their work.
	Persuadee: Yes I agree do you donate to Save The Children? I would love to see the children taken from the trafficking aspect and returned to the families.
Persuader: I do donate to Save the Children and I agree with you that human trafficking is something we need to tackle.  It makes me sad that people including children are subjected to such horrors.  Why our world has to have such evil is beyond me.
	Persuadee: It is called sin and we CAN do a lot about it by making Save the Children fully accountable for the finances we send ,accountability is very necessary to know where the money is going and if it is being used directly foe the child or administrative fees.
Persuader: I agree and Save the Children provides proof on how they spend their money.  You can view that information on their website.  You can also view reports created by independent resources proving they allocate funds as they say.
	Persuadee: This is good I also donated to Feed The Children and withdrew my donations when I checked with the accounting agency responsiable for the allocations of the fumds and only a small 10 cents ever went to the child the rest was what they called operating and administrative fees---I was quite angry as we had donated quite a lot.
Persuader: Wow, that makes me angry when organizations conduct themselves that way.  I understand the need for costs and needing to use some of the money for that.  I like that Save the children specifically states that they use x amount of every dollar.  The financial audits back up their claim.  So I can rest assured that the value of my dollar is going to the children as they promise.
	Persuadee: So Steven are you going to donate today ?
Persuader: I plan to donate for sure.  I figure that half of my earnings would suffice.  It will help children and I will still benefit.  It seems like a proper thing to do.
	Persuadee: Sounds good to me I shall also donate 1/2 of my earnings as we are the voice of these precious children I pray they get clean drinking water good food medical treatment housing and all the needs met if we ALL pull together it can be a better world for these children.
Persuader: Looking at the Saving the Children foundation is appears they are doing extensive work in Africa.  What areas of the world do you think could benefit from this organization?
	Persuadee: Wow that's great what about right here in the USA?There are so many children in poverty here in West Virginia and the other impovished areas.I also see the need in the Gobi desert for good drinking water and medical care.
Persuader: I agree, I hurt for all children facing bad conditions but in the United States we face a lot too.  It would be nice if they also had a allocation schedule for regions of the world.  By that I mean splitting the funding to include our country and specifically spelling out how much goes to each.f
	Persuadee: Is Save The Children only internationaly?We need to have a movement to help the children of our country as well as others  Africa has had so much drought and many deaths due to the heat  I am sure they are also in dire straights.
Persuader: It appears they do spend money the US during disasters or other impacting scenarios.  That is good to know.
	Persuadee: Oh o.k. but it is a disaster in many ways when our own children have no food clean drinking water decent housing but I do understand   so that being said what else do we need to discuss concerning donations?May I add that I was blessed to provid e 2 drinking wells for the Gobi desert and it was and is such a blesing to see the use where they can draw water for the families as well as the livestock  giving is a form of love in many ways.",False,1.0

Persuader: You and me both.  We just need some smarter people in charge.  We also need more people to help others that are not so fortunate.  Wouldn't you agree?
	Persuadee: I think that the government needs to do more to help other. I don't know what someone like me could do. I'm barely making it myself.
Persuader: I am also not doing the greatest with finances at the present moment.  Mturk is actually putting food on the table for me and my children.  But today you and I could make a difference.
	Persuadee: How could I make a difference? I have so little, and need to keep every penny I earn. It's tough out there!
Persuader: I hear that, trust me I do.  Are you a believer in karma?
	Persuadee: I have seen much good karma, only bad. I want to believe, but I just don't know.
Persuader: I have personally noticed many things in the last 10 years where the universe is someway connected and of course there are things that are not known to man or maybe not even be discovered.  But yeah we can make a little difference today and hopefully something good will happen.  Would you be interested in donating some or all of the money you would be getting from this task today?

	Persuadee: How much were thinking of donating? I can't say that I have much room to spare.
Persuader: Okay understandable, tell me what you think about what is happening in different parts of the world today.  For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
	Persuadee: I'd heard something about that. Many are suffering there. 
Persuader: Yes, it is tragic.  We have the opportunity today to help some of those children out through the Save the Children foundation.  Like I said I will match whatever you decide to donate, which could be up to $2.00 each.

Persuader: It seems like it is a really good organization. I just saw a really sad picture today of a kid in West Africa working as a mechanic. I wish everyone everywhere had good access to education and that children didn't have to work in other countries.
	Persuadee: Yes I do too. I was really happy that I was able to do something for the little girl. Since we are talking about it, I wonder how she is now. I know she is an adult now. Hopefully she is having a decent life. 
Persuader: I hope so too. Hopefully, you helped her get there with your donations.
	Persuadee: Yeah. There are so many people all over the world who are having a hard time in life. I will probably donate again in the near future. 
Persuader: Speaking of that, would you be willing to donate some or all of your proceeds from this conversation to Save the Children?
	Persuadee: Sure. I will donate the $0.30 that I am promised after this survey. 
Persuader: Cool, that would be awesome. The researchers will collect the donations and send it to Save the Children.
	Persuadee: Okay. That's great. I love to be apart of organizations like this. I stopped a long time ago because of finances. In the near future I will start donating again.
Persuader: I hear you. There are a lot of things that I would like to contribute to, but don't have the extra money. I think we actually get a bonus of up to $2.00 for this task if I am understanding correctly.
	Persuadee: Oh okay. That's great. Yeah. I didn't know this was for Save the Children, but I am glad that I can contribute a little bit to them. Every little bit counts, right?
Persuader: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for contributing to them. I didn't realize that they help children here in the United States too.
	Persuadee: Oh really? I didn't know that either. I was just thinking about asking about that. I feel bad that we have children in our own country that are having a hard time. 
Persuader: Yes, I was just reading that they are helping still some of the kids affected by Hurricane Harvey.
	Persuadee: Yes. That was a terrible disaster. It really destroyed a lot of people's lives. I can't believe that they are still trying to come up from it now. 
Persuader: I know. It was awful. Well it's been great talking to you. So you are going to donate $.30? Just confirming?

	Persuadee: Hi
Persuader: Have you ever heard of Save the Children Organisation?
	Persuadee: Perhaps. It sounds familiar.
Persuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: So, it is international but only supports developing countries?
Persuader: It gives support where it is more needed
	Persuadee: Ok, what does it do for those in need?
Persuader: In the U.S. and around the world, Save the Children does whatever it takes ¡ª every day and in times of crisis ¡ª to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.  When crisis strikes and children are most vulnerable, they are always among the first to respond and the last to leave. They ensure children's unique needs are met and their voices are heard. 
	Persuadee: What makes Save the Children better than other charities?
Persuader: TWith the help of people like yourself, they've reached 155 mil children around the world and 237,000 in the United States
	Persuadee: What percentage of charitable donations go directly to the fund?
Persuader: 86% goes towards program funding, 9% towards fundraising and 5% towards management
	Persuadee: What qualifies a child for help?
Persuader: Right now, Save the Children remains gravely concerned about the well-being of children in the custody of the U.S. government after crossing our southern border
	Persuadee: How are the funds used to help these children?
Persuader: More than 50% of the funds go towards health, nutrition,and education. Would you be willing to donate to the charity?
	Persuadee: A small amount because I have other charities I support as well.
Persuader: I can understand that. It is very nice to hear that you choose to spend your money in meaningful ways.
	Persuadee: I try to give back although I am often weary of charities. 
Persuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).
	Persuadee: I will donate 50 cent at this time.
Persuader: That is very generous! Thank you! ",False,0.5

	Persuadee: I would like to donate $2 to the charity. How much are you going to donate?
Persuader: Is it $2 each or do we share the bonus?
	Persuadee: I am not sure, however, I think it can be $2 each 
Persuader: Okay, well that's fine, I don't mind donating the whole thing as well.
	Persuadee: Okay, I think that is an excellent idea
Persuader: ""Making a donation agreement too early in the chat may lead to meaningless conversations.""  Well.. lol.  How\'s the weather? 
	Persuadee: The weather here is fine, thank you! I think it is very important to donate to those in need especially organazations that support children.
Persuader: Yea, absolutely.   
	Persuadee: By donating $2 each, I believe that shows that we are compassionate about other people
Persuader: Yes, I always try and donate from these studies if I have the chance.
	Persuadee: I typically donate at the grocery story while at the checkout 
Persuader: Oh that's true, that too.   I like when it's right in front of me, because I like to donate but admittedly I am too lazy to search out new ways.
	Persuadee: Many organiaztions have ways to donate to their employees education. I think that is a good idea and more companies should invest in their employees. 
Persuader: yes thats true too
	Persuadee: I work for a non profit company and we rely heavily on donations to keep the company going

	Persuadee: No but I just copied the link and am going to look at it now.
Persuader: their charity will take any amount of payment, if you are interested
	Persuadee: I don't have much money at all.  I'm lucky to feed myself and my children, but I believe I could probably manage to send $5
Persuader: that will be great, and make a lot of people happy
	Persuadee: I hope so.  So are we agreeing to send $5 to save the children?
Persuader: lets save the children,yea
	Persuadee: Okay.  So what do we do now?
Persuader: first we will have to wait a couple a minutes
	Persuadee: I think that what is happening with Save The Children is a good idea.  I especially like the Send A Girl To School program.
Persuader: i love that idea too! now everyone has an opportunity.
	Persuadee: Exactly.  Often time little girls are left behind in third world countries.  Very, very sad.
Persuader: indeed, it\'s very sad many children have to endure these conditions, just as a friendly reminder ""How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.""

	Persuadee: I'm doing alright. How about yourself?
Persuader: I'm doing well.  Actually, I'd like to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children.  I'd like to ask you to donate some of your payment to them and help out some kids who are in need.
	Persuadee: I'm not terribly interested in donating any of my payment to charity. 
Persuader: May I ask why not?  There are a lot of kids out there who really need all the help they can get, and even just some of your payment for this task could be a huge help to them.
	Persuadee: I really don't have any extra cash to just throw away in a charity. Every little bit I make on this site helps.
Persuader: You're not throwing it away though.  You're helping to make sure children get enough food to survive, as well as getting them access to healthcare and education.  These are basic things that we take for granted, things that everyone should have.
	Persuadee: There are people with much more disposable income than I have that I'm sure make up for me not donating some of my 2 dollars.
Persuader: It's really easy to say you're sure there's someone else out there that's doing enough, so you don't have to.  If everyone said that then these kids would all die waiting to be helped by people who just assume someone else will fix the problem.  Are you really okay with that?
	Persuadee: Yes, I can honestly live with that. 
Persuader: That's really unfortunate.  These kids' families are living off of $10 a day, which I'm sure is a fraction of what you live off of.  You aren't even willing to spare a few cents to help one of these children?
	Persuadee: No I am not. Every cent I give away makes it ever so slightly more difficult for me to pay my bills.
Persuader: But every cent given to these children would go so much farther for them than it would for you.  Would you really notice 5 cents going to charity instead of yourself?
	Persuadee: Yeah I don't really care that much about the children or their families. If it was a friend or a family member that needed financial assistance I'd help but not some random poor family.
Persuader: You can actually go to the website and pick a specific child to help, and even focus on helping a child closer to home.  Might make you feel more connected to these kids.
	Persuadee: That's not enough for me honestly. A picture and a profile isn't enough for me to think about giving away some of my reward.
Persuader: How would you feel if you were the one in need and someone said that about you?  a few cents is negligible to you, but it can do a world of good for these children.
	Persuadee: I'd be understanding because everyone's lives are different and you can't always imagine what their current situation is just by looking at them. If I was in need I would be perfectly fine with not bieng donated to because they worked for their money so it's up to them to decide what they do with it.
Persuader: But you won't be understanding that there are children suffering and even the slightest bit of help from you would do a world of good for them?
	Persuadee: I do understand that I could donate and possibly help suffering families. I just don't care and I would like the full reward for myself.

	Persuadee: It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?
Persuader: Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need
	Persuadee: The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. Children should be our top priority all across the world. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?
Persuader: Oh there are quiet a few ways. For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.

	Persuadee: They are our future exactly. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. How long have you been supporting this charity?
Persuader: I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.

Persuader: Yup. They promote children's rights and help support children in developing countries
	Persuadee: I always wonder if programs like that use too much of what they get for ""administrative"" costs.
Persuader: Yeah, some organizations probably spend a lot on that. In 2017, 86% of Save the Children's expenditures went to program services
	Persuadee: OH! That's a great ratio, (or percentage). 
Persuader: Yeah! It's ranked really highly among other nonprofit organizations. Their independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars they spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. They keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.
	Persuadee: I'm delighted to learn that! 
Persuader: Yes! They've helped 157 million children in 120 countries. Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. When you focus on children in rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Through Save the Children's education, protection and emergency programs, they reached 638,000 kids in 2016 alone.
	Persuadee: You've hit on one of my concerns.  I worry about American children (since I live there). But it's not just rural kids who have needs.  Children in urban areas are sometimes at risk as well. Does Save the Children address that area?
Persuader: That's definitely true. Save the Children targets America's most isolated and underserved children. 20% of children in the US grows up in poverty; of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural, which is why rural America is a focus for this organization. It doesn't mean that children in urban areas aren't important too, of course!
	Persuadee: That's true. Every child matters and every child's parent(s) too! I love the wonder that kids have for almost everything! And they can't experience joy if their bellies are empty.

Persuader: Instead of the typical charities that help children in a far away land, we here use state of the art location technology to help children in need right in your own community so you can see your money at work personally
	Persuadee: What would my money do exactly
Persuader: It would go to the three most important things that a child need. Food, shelter, and education. The majority of your donation would go towards education as that is often the most difficult to provide for the children
	Persuadee: How would I know that the money is actually being used to help children and not just pocketed by the people that run the c harity

Persuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. You can refer to Save the Children's website to gather more information if you like to.   URL 
	Persuadee: ooo ok...thats good that there is a organization put together to help children in other countries
Persuader: Yes, it is good. But they are really under funded. Would you be willing to donate to the charity now?
	Persuadee: I will have to read up more about the organization before i just give my money up because there is fake charities in the world
Persuader: I understand that. Your donation is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc. Your donation will make a tangible impact for the world.
	Persuadee: Yes i understand that because every sunday i would go to the homeless shelter in my town and help collect clothes for the people that need it.it is something i do once a week because it is the right thing to do..
Persuader: It is the right thing to do. That helps people directly in your community. A lot of these children don't have people like you in their community. There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Your small donation can address such problems.
	Persuadee: Yes i have read about that and that is said for those children...where are you from?

	Persuadee: yes everything is high priced 
Persuader: I figured! IN is really conservative. Again, look over the charity information and consider a small donation

Persuader: It is an organization that helps with children's rights to health, education, and safety. 
	Persuadee: That sounds like a worthwhile endeavor.
Persuader: I think so too! The organization is currently looking for donations. How much would you be willing to donate to their organization?
	Persuadee: I'm not sure. It sounds like something I would be willing to donate to, but I have been fooled before. How much of my donation is actually used for children and how much is lost to administrative costs?
Persuader: According to their website, 5% of the donation goes to management and general, 9% is fundraising, and the remaining goes to the programs. You can donate directly from your bonus of $2- Can I get a commitment from you for any of the $2 to help the children? 
	Persuadee: What does this organisation provide? Is it legal services, or direct medical, educational, and safety products and services?
Persuader: They are advocates for our lower income students and children who have been struck by emergencies. They do a lot with education and all around mental health. You should take a look at their website  URL  There is a lot of beneficial information and ways to help get involved further.
	Persuadee: I am currentloy looking at the website. All these programs look good and helpfull, but when providing care and services to children without also ensuring the stability of their familiy or living situation I am dubious about the efficacy of these programs. Making sure a child is free of disease and is well-fed is good, but then tossing them into the street seems counterproductive. I can't seem to find information on how this problem is dealt with.
Persuader: Based on the other information provided, it does seem that they are consistently there to provide the services for the children therefore I am lead to believe they must have some sort of follow up. The lack of support for the poverty stricken children in the US and in other countries is sad. Programs like this one need our support and voices like yours to make improvements to keep the organizations growing. Your $2 or any donation you decide to make will help the children now and hopefully keep the program growing to learn and do more.
	Persuadee: I spoke too soon. Just a few clicks after my last statement I found the information I was looking for. The also provide health education and services to at-risk families as well as working locally to provide access to food and clean water. I am currently looking for statistics on long-term results and testimonials.= befoire I make a final decision.
Persuader: I'm so glad you found the information you were looking for. We spend so much money of small things like candy, coffee, and snacks. Those small purchases can be saved to help others. 
	Persuadee: I absolutely agree. I am pleased to discover they go all over the world. It appears to be a massive undertaking which they are constantly working to expand. I am pleasantly surprised that they are able to do this without more overhead.
Persuader: With the information you have found, can we get you to make a donation? Super easy to donate and as you have found, it is a great organization.
	Persuadee: I am dismayed to discover that only 7% of thier resources is going into the middle East and Euraisa. With the widespread problems there it seems a small amount. Perhaps it is too dangerous or possibly the local governments won't let them in. Have you seen any information about that?
Persuader: I didn't see that. I'm glad they are able to provide any help. I can't image that it is easy getting to other countries to provide aide. The areas they seem to go to are pretty dangerous. 
	Persuadee: Looking att he map of the globe it shows a lot of grayed out areas in the middle east, so it must be a political road block keeping them out. I also noticed only 6% going to Latin America. That also seems low considering the problems that exist in some of those areas.
Persuader: It does. I bet they will eventually be able to raise those numbers as they expand. It will be interesting to watch their growth and how they impact the world. I hope that through our conversations and your research that you have made the decision to make a donation.
	Persuadee: I have. I feel very good about this Organization and the work they do. I am convinced they are a positive force in the world and contribute greatly to the elevation of the the human condition across the globe.
