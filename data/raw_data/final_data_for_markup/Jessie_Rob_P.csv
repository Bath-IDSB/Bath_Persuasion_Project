Persuader: what is that , what is sadder?
	Persuadee: An elderly man or woman who is too poor to afford food.  At one point in their life, they had so much to look forward to.  But now they've found themselves at the end and they are so powerless that they cannot even feed themselves.  I cannot fathom that level of sadness to sit there at the end of a very long life and to wonder how you got there...

	Persuadee: Oh nice. Is that the organization that provides food for kids around the world?
Persuader: Correct, With a primary focus on those in troubled nations (such as war zones or poorly developed nations). If you would like to help, a donation from you could help save the thousands of children that deal with violence and hunger as a daily part of their lives.
	Persuadee: Do you provide other things besides food?
Persuader: Of course, one of our focus points is to provide health care, education, and safety to these children to help give them a way out of their troubled lives. And your small donation can go a long way, something as small as the price of a candy bar can be the difference in these kids lives.
	Persuadee: Oh wow, that's a lot. what percent of my donation goes directly to the kids?
Persuader: In 2017 86% of all fund raise went directly to the children in need, and of the 86%, 34% was directly put into providing food and nutrition.
	Persuadee: And the other percent that didn't go to food went to what? 
Persuader: Education, Emergency Relief, HIV/Aids treatment, and helping the children stay in a safe environment. I know its easy to ignore these children because they are half way around the world, but they need your help. Nearly 5.6 million children die each year due to preventable and treatable causes. Malnutrition contributes to the deaths of children and a lifetime of poor health. All it takes is an easy donation from you to help these children

Persuader: Much of the focus right now goes to war torn countries like Syria, but your donation would also go to help those who were hurt by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Hurricane Maria in the Gulf of Mexico

Persuader: We tried camping this summer, but got rained on! I am wondering, have you heard about the Save the Children charity?
	Persuadee: Yes I have. 
Persuader: Oh good! Then you are familiar with them. I wanted to ask if you would be willing to donate any of today's pay to STC. Even $0.05 would help.
	Persuadee:  Do they have a website where I can go and read more about them?
Persuader: Yes, their website is  URL  Let me know if the link I sent comes through.
	Persuadee: Yes it did. How do donate with you today?
Persuader: You just have to tell me what amount you would like to donate from today's pay. If you want to give ten cents tell me $0.10.
	Persuadee: Would you be ok taking .01$?
Persuader: Yes, that would be great. STC makes sure 90% of donations go directly to the kids. Did you see how much even a little can help?

Persuader: Ha! Yeah. We have those storms now. It's pretty scary now. What do you do for a living. 
	Persuadee: I'm retired. Used to sell health insurance. Worked for an HMO, back in the days when health insurance wasn't such a dirty word.
Persuader: Nice. Have you ever heard of save the children?

Persuader: Kind of...Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
	Persuadee: Yes. I care about those things. I did 3 mission trips to Africa working with children orphaned by AIDS and placed in foster homes by a Christian organization.

	Persuadee: I have donated to them in the past. Do you donate through MTurk only?
Persuader: Well, today all donations are directlt deducted from the Mturk task payment so would you be interested in donating today?
	Persuadee: I would, I usually donate some portion of my winnings when it's a children's charity. They are the most vulnerable in society.
Persuader: Oh, I know children did not ask to grow up in these coditions adults have let them down in so many ways
	Persuadee: I know, it's also so sad the the more nutricious foods are always the most expensive. I donate to the NYC Food bank also. They help a lot of city kids.

	Persuadee: do you know alot about save the children and how much of the money they raise would actually go to the children
Persuader: Any of the money you choose to donate would go directly and entirely towards the charity. I have limited info on the cause but I can assure you they provide help to children in the needy areas around the world, where poverty affects children the worst.
	Persuadee: well I would be willing to donate .50 to the charity
Persuader: That is wonderful, I'm glad to hear it. The children will benefit immensely from your donation. It will be deducted from your task payment and go directly to helping needy kids around the globe!

Persuader: So much food goes to waste its horrible! The dumpsters in cities are filled with food that could feed all the hungry in the world.
	Persuadee: that is very true not to mention many restaraunts have a policy to throw out good food everyday and not donate it. I read somewhere that france I think its france is making it illegal for stores to throw the food out
Persuader: That is awesome to hear about France I hope other countries follow that trend, I think if all the restaurants and grocery stores donated food that would of been thrown away they could fix the hunger issue overnight.
	Persuadee: its so true especially here in the usa, even places like a donut shop or a pizza place if they would just take the stuff they are throwing out at the end of the day to a shelter or somewhere where people can come get it. it would really help out. 
Persuader: They really should have different policies in place, we have more than enough hungry and homeless to eat all the excess. We certainly have way too much excess here in the USA
	Persuadee: I agree, I do wish I could give more but I am struggling myself.. and the cost of food just keeps going up.. I do not even bother making a list anymore.. its whatever is on sale thats what I eat.
Persuader: I'm the same way, prices just keep going up and up but at least the sales make shopping possible. It can almost be a fun game to have to make a meal plan from only whats on sale.
	Persuadee: yes it can be it brings out the creativity in you.. and I am grateful to be able to buy food even if it is only whats on sale

Persuader: Ok that's great. The research team will deduct it from your earnings and send the donation on it's way.  Are you sure you can't sacrifice any more?
	Persuadee: only a dollar because I need to make my time worth it as this is my main job.
Persuader: I completely understand.  Consider this, in the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. It's fine if you value a dollar more than saving the lives of innocent children, we all have our priorities 
	Persuadee: I don't value anything over the life of others. That's why I am willing to sacrifice one dollar of the bonus for the time spent. If I didn't value others lifes I wouldn't donate anything at all. I donate money all the time.
Persuader:  URL  Check it out if you'd like, it really is a good cause.  I know this hit is garbage and much too little pay, but it doesn't mean that children have to suffer.  What's another in the grand scheme of things to you anyway, you can't even buy a soda for that anymore.

	Persuadee: Actually yes, I have heard of this organization. I believe they have a good reputation. 
Persuader: They do. There are a number of similar organizations but Save The Children is probably the one with the highest reputation. They do a great job and make a serious impact on a lot of lives that might otherwise be lost. They reduce a LOT of suffering.
	Persuadee: Do you know how they use the money? Does it go directly to children and their families? Or does it go to a ""hand out"" type of administration? 
Persuader: They say that independant audits show that 9 out of 10 dollars donated go to programs. They do their best to keep their administrative costs low to maximize how much goes to help.
	Persuadee: I do like that. It is important when I consider my giving that the money goes as directly to the afflicted people as it is able. I don't like wastefulness of advertising or self promotion. 
Persuader: Why I ask is that the study has given you an opportunity to donate to the organization. Do you think you would like to donate? The research team would collect the donations and pass them on. The donation would from from your task payment, but every dollar helps.
	Persuadee: How much, ideally, would you be looking for me to donate? 
Persuader: I think a dollar would be very generous. That's what I would suggest. I wouldn't want to ask you to give up all your reward.
	Persuadee: It is such a small amount I think I could do better than a dollar. Do you ever know what part of the world your donation ends up in? 
Persuader: My research shows they do things all over the world, but I would expect that right now they're concentrating on war zones with lots of refugees, like Syria and several places in Africa where there's fighting.
	Persuadee: That would be a great use of their resources. 
Persuader: There are thousands of Syrian children who have grown up in refugee camps, never knowing home. If nothing else, the organization can make their lives a little more bearable until the poltical situation can be resolved and they can go back.

Persuader: It's an international, nongovernmental agency that promotes children's rights in developing countries.
	Persuadee: So it's not an aid-type of charity, but more like legal work?
Persuader: No. It helps with education and food, especially for kids in war-torn countries.
	Persuadee: So it sends food and books to these countries?
Persuader: Yes. It has great credentials. That's something that's important to me, especially as I have limited amounts to donate.
	Persuadee: So Charity Navigator gives it a good rating? Don't want to support one that spends a lot on administrative or fundraising costs.
Persuader: I agree with you! It doesn't spend a lot on administrative costs. I'm very particular about that, too.
	Persuadee: What percentage of donations go to the actual countries then?
Persuader: I'm going to have to look that up. Give me a sec.
	Persuadee: No problem. Also curious how much they gave out in past year or so.
Persuader: 86% goes to program services. I'm going to donate $1 of my earnings on this HIT. It's less than the cost of a cup of coffee these days.
	Persuadee: What countries have they given money too?
Persuader: Syria is a big one. There are kids that are under the daily threat of violence. Mainly developing countries in war zones.

Persuader: Think about donating a little bit of your HIT.  50 cents?

Persuader: Chidren's welfare. You know how you feel when you read about some abused child?

Persuader: Well, that's great, but you know the BIGGEST problem is kids with poor parents (or no parent around), not the ones that are mistreated.
	Persuadee: Yes, I do think that is an important issue to consider.
Persuader: Do you know any children personally who show up for school half-dressed or hungry?
	Persuadee: I do not.
Persuader: That's good. Unfortunately I do, and for all the church groups and local government efforts, they continue to suffer.
	Persuadee: I see. It's unfortunate that people, especially children, continue to slip through the cracks of society despite the efforts of these organizations.
Persuader: Well, government and most local social welfare groups go thru the PARENTS; they provide FAMILY support, and short of abuse there's no way they can force the money to be filtered down to the kids. That's why private welfare groups (many associated with schools, like I was implying) are an important way to address these kids' needs DIRECTLY.
	Persuadee: Hm...I wasn't aware it was possible for some of these groups to bypass guardianship of these children and give help to these kids directly. This is the first I've heard of this.
Persuader: It's not like that: they provide school and after-school meals and social support (like school sorts and groups do.) ALL ABOVE BOAFRD and nothing shady. In fact, what brought me to this survey is pretty amazing (somewhat coincidental!)

Persuader: Oh cool I'm vegan too actually. It was the same for me, I made the switch to reduce cancer risk since there's a lot of that in my family, but eventually it became an environmental/animal rights thing. I've been vegan for about 6 years and was vegetarian for about 5 before that. I'm so sorry to hear hurricane Harvey affected you. Were there any government programs or non-profits that helped you to recover?
	Persuadee: Yes, the government program actually helped us tremendously. I changed to a Vegan diet due to a Cancer risk as well, every woman but me in my family has had some type of cancer. I actually have converted my elderly mother to a Vegan diet over the last year, she's doing great!

Persuader: perfect that is a good amount. it makes a difference to help children.

445,"Persuader: hello, what you think about charities?
	Persuadee: In general I'm in favor of them.  I don't think they can completely replace governmental assistance, and there are some that are better than others (both in the sense that they align more closely with my beliefs and values, and in the sense that they're well-run and actually assist the causes they claim to).
Persuader: do you ever gave money to a charity?
	Persuadee: Yes I do.
Persuader: what kind of charity was that?
	Persuadee: Environmental charities, charities that assist people going through difficult times, and charities that try to improve society.

	Persuadee: No thank you as there is no guarantee to this. I'd rather donate locally
Persuader: I agree donating locally is also important.  However, there are so many children that could benefit from just pennies.

Persuader: It is a great charity, which I support personally on a monthly basis.  I sponsor two children through them.  Their overhead is very low compared to Save the Children.

Persuader: Yes, that sounds good.  Certainly a lot of them need homes.

Persuader: I am a volunteer I believe 100% goes to the charity.
	Persuadee: What do you do ?  awesome if that's true, 100% really goes right to the children?
Persuader: There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

Persuader: We have volunteer groups already in place in these areas. I don't believe admin goes to the war torn coutries it is mostly missionaries.
