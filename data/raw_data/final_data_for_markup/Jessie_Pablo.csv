	Persuadee: Hi.  It sounds familiar but I'm not sure.
Persuader: Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries. It's a great organization!

Persuader: Wonderful! The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.
	Persuadee: Sounds good.  Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?
Persuader: Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources
	Persuadee: That's interesting.  I might want to volunteer too.
Persuader: It's a very rewarding experience. A productive activity to fill your free time with. :)
	Persuadee: It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.
Persuader: Certainly. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.
	Persuadee: Thanks for telling me about it.
Persuader: You are welcome! Thank you for your kind donation.

Persuader: Same here, they have many option to help, We can donate or We can participate in their events
	Persuadee: I don't know much about their events.  But I have money that I can donate.
Persuader: I usually like to help financially too, since I do not have many off days to join event. Some of their members even travel to different countries to help in person. I believe that is a big thing to do
	Persuadee: I wouldn't have the time off to do that.  But that's pretty cool what they do.
Persuader: Yes, they are also connected to big companies like IKEA and Walt Disney. I would like to see part of my purchase will be donated
	Persuadee: Donating part of a purchase is such an easy way for a large amount of people to donate money.
Persuader: Exactly, I also like how there are HITs which encourage you to donate. It makes me happy to donate part or all of my bonus
	Persuadee: If it's a charity I believe in that's a great way.  I donate to many local charities in my city.
Persuader: that is so nice of you. like ""Save the Children"" has many options to donate. You can directly donate through website, It has a minimum amount, but you can also donate part of the HIT reward at the end of the conversation, It can be 0 or 1 cent or any other amount
	Persuadee: I think I'll probably donate at the end of this conversation.  Will you be doing so as well?

Persuader: save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.
	Persuadee: How do they help the children?
Persuader: they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.
	Persuadee: That sounds great. How can I get involved?
Persuader: you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?

	Persuadee: I think they are the future of the world and in general, I like them.
Persuader: I agree. What would you think of donating to Save The Children, a charity organization dedicated to helping children in poor third-world countries have a brighter future?
	Persuadee: I think we have bigger problems to solve than helping children in poor third-world countries, and if I decide to donate money it would be to a different organization
Persuader: That's a shame. I always donate 10% of my income to charities. Why don't you want to help starving children?
	Persuadee: because I prefer to donate money to organizations attacking bigger problems, it's just a matter of priorities
Persuader: Some of these children haven't eaten for days. They're skin and bones. What could be more important than basic human decency?
	Persuadee: There are a lot of problems more important than feeding kids. Cancer research for example, water or basic health in poor countries. Basic human decency is not just food.
Persuader: None of those things matter to children who are dying right now of hunger. They won't be alive to enjoy those benefits if we don't take care of them now.
	Persuadee: If you think that way then you have never seen sickness and people suffering from easily treated health problems. I've seen cancer way too close to me to make me believe that's way more important to solve than feeding kids in another country.
Persuader: You won't even donate $1? That's half of what you'll be making from this study alone. You wouldn't even notice it's absece
	Persuadee: I would donate and I donated every year way more than that but to organizations attacking problems that I think should be solved first
Persuader: And how much money do you spend on luxuries like coffee, soda, fast food, etc? You really think that money couldn't be better used in Syria?
	Persuadee: I think you got the wrong person, I don't spend money on luxuries because I have not enough money to be able to do that. I cook my own food and I don't drink coffee or soda, and I still donate money to help causes I believe should be solved. I do believe that money could be used better than sending it to Syria
Persuader: That's short-sighted. Solving cancer or repairing infrastructure won't matter to the millions that die from lack of food.
	Persuadee: You are the one short-sighted. I didn't say anything about repairing infrastructure, and yes, solving cancer would be way better used money than sending it to Syria.
Persuader: You said water. That's infrastructure. Do you even know what you're talking about?
	Persuadee: No, you are wrong, water is not infrastructure, you should read a little bit before you say something liked that
Persuader: lol google it if you don't believe me:  URL

	Persuadee: I have helped children outside my country in the past. I believe donations of any amount help make a difference 
Persuader: You sound like a very generous person. I have personal history as my husband was a refugee as a child. We have a blended family. It just makes me sad that children have to suffer no matter where they are. Save the children is a great organization. Would you consider a donation to them?

Persuader: Well, how do you feel about charity's like Save the Children? Do you donate often?
	Persuadee: I haven't donated to them but i'm sympathetic to their cause
Persuader: Would you ever consider donating?
	Persuadee: Do you know what the donations go to? i'm not very well versed on the details 
Persuader: Sure, they go to many things well, revolving around children anyway. Some of their funding goes to the refugee children who are going hungry, without education, and medical help. They go to children who have been through natural disasters to help them and their families rebuild the communities like the most recent hurrican in Texas. They also fund programs for inner city kids to have a safe haven while continuing their education.
	Persuadee: are you a supporter / donor?
Persuader: Yes, I've donated reguarly, most of the time I wish I could do more but even the smallest amounts help.... even pennies add up if there's enough ::)
	Persuadee: i would think about donating something at some point. 
Persuader: Well, today the research team are giving all of us the oppurtunity to donate some of our bonus money if we are interested in doing so....  
	Persuadee: how much have you donated today? or intend to donate today?
Persuader: I'm going to donate $.25 of mine like I said it's not much but something is better then nothing at least that's what I've been told since I was a kid :)
	Persuadee: can you tell me anything else about save the children?
Persuader: Well, they're a international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. And all of the donations they recieve go towards the children unlike other charities who only donate a portion.
	Persuadee: okay, id be willing to donate 30 cents to them.

	Persuadee: Hi Maria. I'm doing fine, thanks! :)
Persuader: So I just got involved with this charity called Save the Children. I don't know if you remember the actress Sally Struthers from All in the Family, but she used to promote it. Anyway, they are really involved in helping the children in Syria.
	Persuadee: Oh nice. What kind of work do they do with children?
Persuader: They go into places where many other agencies won't go...war torn nations like Somalia, Venezuela and Syria. They specifically concentrate on helping children, who really are innocent and can't fend for themselves. Many of them are orphans.
	Persuadee: That sounds like a pretty good cause. Are they a non-profit? Do you know how they are funded?
Persuader: Yes they are definitely non-profit. They get donations from big donors like corporations, but a lot of their funding comes from people like you and me who give smaller amounts. Any little bit helps. When you consider that workers in many countries make $3.00 a day, just 50 cents can make a huge difference in the life of a child.
	Persuadee: That's true. Every little bit counts, I suppose.
Persuader: I usually am one who supports animal welfare charities and environmental charities, but Save the Children is one of the few children's charities that I really have a lot of respect for. I am going to donate some of my task money. I was wondering if you would be interested in doing the same. It doesn't have to be a lot...just what you feel moved to donate. Any bit makes a difference.
	Persuadee: Oh i'm a big animal lover too! I'd definitely be interested in donating, but can I ask a few questions first?
Persuader: Sure! I'll answer as best as I can.
	Persuadee: Awesome. Do you know how much of our donations go directly to help the children? Sorry, to ask but I've contributed to a few that were less than open about it...
Persuader: charity navigator says 88.3% which is in line with similar charities that do the same thing
	Persuadee: Oh, that's actually pretty good. I understand there always has to be room for admin costs and outreach. Also, do you know how we actually make a donation?
Persuader: Yes. The team will monitor this conversation, and once I ask you what you want to give, they will take care of it. Being that this is mechanical turk and that it is an academic survey, I believe they are trustworthy and will get the money to the charity. So....if you have decided to donate, how much would you like to donate?
	Persuadee: Okay, sounds good. Is there a limit to what we can donate? I think we only get $0.30 for this HIT, so can I donate all or part of that?
Persuader: You can donate anywhere from 0 to 30 cents. The decision is yours. And thank you for whatever you decide to give. 
	Persuadee: Okay, I'll donate all $0.30 then: it's not a lot, but I guess it's better than nothing!

Persuader: Not yet but I am traveling to Uganda with STC in March! Have you ever wanted to do something like that?
	Persuadee: It would be quite exciting I bet. What will you do when you get there? 
Persuader: We will be setting up a pseudo- children's hospital. More like a nurses station to help sick kiddos in remote villages.
	Persuadee: That's awesome. I bet they can use the help.
Persuader: They definitely can! And you can help, too!
	Persuadee: How could I do that?
Persuader: By supporting STC! Would you like to learn how?
	Persuadee: Sure. I would like that.
Persuader: There is no such thing as a small donation. If you'd be willing, you could donate some or all of your incoming payment for this task to STC! It'd be nothing more than a bag of chips at the store. Less than, even!

	Persuadee: Not at this time because I just did a donation to ALS yesterday, maybe another time.
Persuader: Well do you mind if I tell you a little bit more about the foundation?
	Persuadee: Sure go ahead.
Persuader: What a lot of people don't realize is how much they do. They help kids all of the world, including the US. They help with nutrition and education and safety. Sometimes it is easy to forget how wonderful it is to have you basic needs met without worry.

Persuader: They are rated very highly on Charity Navigator for transparency and efficiency. Over 88 cents on the dollar goes directly to help children.
	Persuadee: That is a high percent. I am just a bit worried about donating to charities. I donated every month for years to United Way, until the admin was arrested for embezzling!!!
Persuader: That's a very reasonable concern. Save the Children has been helping kids for nearly 100 years. They are one of the most trusted charities in the world. 
	Persuadee: I also like to donate to local charities; Loaves and Fishes, Good Will, and Salvation Army. 
Persuader: Those are all great causes. One great thing about Save the Children is their international scope. For example, millions of Syrian children with a constant threat of violence. That is a crisis that requires an international solution.

Persuader: They are lack of medicine when they are sick.   They don't have money to see the doctor.

	Persuadee: Social media might be a better platform for gaining donations. I would actual consider making a donation that way because it appears more trustworthy
Persuader: If that works for you, sure. I would be happy with that, because the need is so large. Our government is doing almost nothing to help children in need.

Persuader: Well yes. They can need much more than that, unfortunately. Fresh water and clothing is often not available in the third world.
	Persuadee: Yes, there is much more. When there is so much going on in the US in regards to government neglect, it is difficult to think about the struggles of the third world countries.

Persuader: The researchers of this hit will make sure the money goes to save the children. Save the Children is a world wide organization that helps kids in war torn areas.
	Persuadee: It sounds like a good idea, but I often get peppered with requests to donate money to various charities -- when I donate I do it to causes that I know about.  If I donated to every cause I would be giving away a lot of money and I already lose 20% to taxes.

Persuader: True, but there - the kids are lucky to get a meal a day. Save the children helps with that.
