It's easy to donate when you feel attached to the situation, but helping someone you don't know takes a really special kind of person.\n\tPersuadee: yes, plus your making a difference in other peoples lives or animals. it is gods work.\nPersuader: I agree! Have you ever volunteered your time for a charity?\n\tPersuadee: I have made donations to the charity, but I have never volunteered for one.\nPersuader: We're all so busy or sometimes it's hard to get out to help so donating is a really good way to be able to help.

In 2018 many children are affected by wars (for example Syria). \n\tPersuadee: yes, I heard they are a good organization and are willing to help as much children as positive. is 0.30 cents a good donation to give?\nPersuader: Anything you could donate would be amazing, from .01 to the full $2.

Do you think you could give a little more?\n\tPersuadee: i was thinking 0.30 as the amount I want to give. but I could up to to 0.50 cents\nPersuader: That's great.

I have a really important question to ask of you\n\tPersuadee: Sure, I'm up for answering some questions.\nPersuader: I have been very lucky to be apart of a non-governmental organization called Save the Children and it provides relief and support to children in developing country\n\tPersuadee: That sounds interesting. Sounds like good meaningful work for a good cause.\nPersuader: It's so meaningful! Right now we are preparing a large shipment of supplies for Puerto Rico. There are families that we are in close contact with who have lost their children in the hurricane. More and more families are coming out of the woodwork, and we are becoming short on funds to help them. All I am asking is for the possibility of you to make a kind donation of two dollars so that we can ship more supplies to devastated families in Puerto Rico\n\tPersuadee: I do feel sorry for the american citizens in Puerto Rico that have been ignored by our government. I want to help, but I would rather just donate 1 dollar because to be frank I don't know much about the Save the Children organization. \nPersuader: We would really appreciate that. Right now, we are an international organization that has helped over 250,000 children in developing countries. We are based in the United States, and all of the people who participate in this organization have a background involving children (mainly teachers and parents). With donations, we are projected to help over 750,000 children in the next three years.\n\tPersuadee: I'll donate 1 dollar. Seems like a good organization that helps people in need. \nPersuader: I'm sorry, my computer kind of glitched out. How much would you like to donate to the organization now? Your donation will be deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $) to all of your payment ($2)\n\tPersuadee: $1.00 dollar donation\nPersuader: Thank you very much. You are helping us give a wonderful service.\n\tPersuadee: no problem. It's not much by myself, but I hope a lot of people pitching together makes a difference\nPersuader: Exactly. It's surprising how $100 can go so far within this organization.\n\tPersuadee: I'm disappointed that the government isn't helping puerto rico like it did with katrina or any other disaster\nPersuader: I completely understand, especially because they are our territory. That's why organizations have stepped up and taking the place of the government. We are so desperately in need of money though, so we sincerely  thank you.\n\tPersuadee: You're welcome! Hope things get better soon for puerto ricans", "label": [[11, 16, "Conventional-Opening"]], "idx": 213}
